This one would be good anytime you make nazis angry and triggered it s a big win They should do Hitler black so it s easier to spot nazis online -> Eh I dunno about that one If you re doing a comedy or regular show I think there d be less pushback with a black hitler though even that might be taken as racism But the meme here is about a documentary Featuring a black hitler could be liable to people not only thinking it s just racist but that the whole show is bad because they re historically inaccurate Not sure if it s a good comparison but like a documentary about the African slave trade featuring a bunch of white dudes being forced to work on a plantation
r therightcantmeme -> These are making fun of Netflix nothing to do with politics unless someone brings them up

Am i missing something from the original Tarzan Afaik in all the movies he s been cast as white but i know it originated in comics or novels or something -> Disney has been making live action movies in which they race swap the main character People including myself would love to see Disney race swap Tarzan to a black man and see how well that goes over with the general population

Japan is more scared of North Korea I mean I am too -> Im fairly certain Japan is more worried about China given the number of times they tested ballistic missiles by firing them over Japanese airspace
Memers try not to make excuses for dictatorships challenge impossible -> B but America bad
So your saying America is bad for warning other countries that they might be bombed with nukes that are severely times more powerful then the ones dropped on Japan because America bomb japan in word war two -> I m saying that the US is the only country that used nuclear bombs and Japan experienced it And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries The power of nuclear bombs is relative At that time those two bombs were the most powerful weapons
Yes how dare America bomb Hitler s allies ending a world war Monsters -> You re expecting people to know anything about history
Every time a country threatens another with nukes it just shows that they only care about being on top not protecting their people -> It also shows the country is not strong military wise It s like bringing a gun to a fist fight
The big powers about to engage in nuclear war Japan who didn t build any nuclear weapons because of principles -> I mean if I was ground zero for that shit I wouldn t want to make nukes either
I m saying that the US is the only country that used nuclear bombs and Japan experienced it And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries -> If that s true it s great news since the US has suffered some pretty notable military defeats since WWII and never used nukes If the equivalency you re drawing between the US and Russia is true the world should be spared some truly horrific things
Well maybe they should ve thought about that before touching our boats -> or you before touching their submarine
Wtf japan gonna do watch send hentai army -> fr japan has devolved so much from its past self
Don t worry guys Japan has the power of anime by their side -> The power of anime failed twice
Russia North Korea and China have nukes But what do Japan have Humans in planes This is a joke please don t take offense -> Fun fact American soldiers called the kamikaze pilots Baka Bombs
america bombed japan because of the imperials it was for the best -> Yeah and bin laden banged the plane on tower cause he didn t like its location it was for the best
The comments here are concerning Japan was not nuked to save American lives America already won the war The specifics of why are argued by historians some say it was to ensure a more absolute surrender some say it was to ease control of Japan under America some say it was to show American dominance among the allies but the most common explanation is that it was a show of force against soviets who had just entered the war to control as much of the region as possible If it was because the japanese wouldn t have surrendered they d nuke Tokyo And no this doesn t somehow absolve imperial Japan of their crimes They were far worse than America throughout the course of the war arguably worse than Nazi Germany but that doesn t make nuking civilians ok in the way internment camps weren t ok -> To save American lives is definetly one of the reasons for the nukes It can be debated whether or not it was justified but the facts are that a mainland invasion of Japan would be costly
Japan of all countries seems to have the shittiest luck Constantly at war in the past and then nuked twice -> A mainland invasion would have been worse for Japan than nukes
Jeez I wonder which country invented the abomination that are nukes Should ve just stayed as an energy source SMH -> Yeah how dare they figure it out first before the Germans and Soviets Should ve just invaded Japan instead and lost a million men and god knows how many civilians instead s
Oooh downvotes yall salty Is this why Americans don t want to teach history -> You dumb fucks know that every American school is different right I learned about everything our government did from manifest destiny to slavery the Tuskegee experiment Mk ultra and all the rest If your understanding of a country is limited to reddit memes you probably don t have room to talk about the ignorance of others Also you know we dropped those nukes on Hitler s allies to end a world war right What country are you from Let s see how well you know your own history
Im fairly certain Japan is more worried about China given the number of times they tested ballistic missiles by firing them over Japanese airspace -> North Korean missiles launched over Japan Korean missile launches over Japan svg
Why -> Because they re irrational to the point of being self destructive
North Korea isn t a threat to anyone especially not a threat if you live in the USA No country can invade us successfully -> He didn t say North Korea is a threat to the USA Just that Japan is worried about North Korea as they should be with them constantly shooting missiles in their direction
B but America bad -> Always it s never done anything good or noteworthy like Europe and Asia Obviously
No you just don t understand how big brained and original OP is -> Fair point I ll take my leave
I agree it was probably statistically needed but Jesus Christ they dropped two nuclear bombs on large cities and instatly pulverized hundreds of thousands of innocent individuals who never did anything wrong -> It s not like the former was any better I know this sounds like a tribe mentality but better them than us ya know I love my great grandfather and I d rather him with us than a framed purple heart of a great man I d never have the privilege to know Memes like this paint the picture that the United States did this for shits and giggles rather than to end the war hundreds of good men would die to a population who viewed their emperor as a God and openly and plainly supported the subjugation of Asia
I m saying that the US is the only country that used nuclear bombs and Japan experienced it And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries The power of nuclear bombs is relative At that time those two bombs were the most powerful weapons -> So your logic is America shouldn t have any right to warn it s ally that two countries that are extremely close may nuke them a lot because American nuke them nearly a hundred years ago
Tell me did US used the nuclear weapon on military objects or basically just on two huge cities with lots of civilians and children So yeah it looks like a monster move -> We dropped leaflets telling them the bomb was coming to destroy the military bases in those cities The Japanese government told them it was a trick The real monstrous thing was the fire bombing of Tokyo that was only done to break their spirits
They bombed Japan after them surrendered and they bombed time -> That is completely wrong they literally had to worse Hirohito to surrender at gun point lol
Many historians say it was actually Russia declaring war on Japan and not the atomic bombs that convinced them to surrender EDIT Adding my academic sources since y all are skeptical Gen Anami on Aug remarked that the atomic bombings were no more menacing than the fire bombing that Japan had endured for months Ward Wilson in Foreign Policy bomb didnt beat japan stalin did Prime Minister Kantaro Suzuki explained on Aug that Japan had to surrender quickly because the Soviet Union will take not only Manchuria Korea Karafuto but also Hokkaido This would destroy the foundation of Japan We must end the war when we can deal with the United States Historians Gar Alperovitz and Martin Sherwin hiroshima anniversary japan atomic bombs Even Anami s fantastic suggestion that the United States had more than atomic bombs and planned to bomb Tokyo next did not change the opinions of either the peace party or the war party at all Rather what decisively changed the views of the Japanese ruling elite was the Soviet entry into the war It catapulted the Japanese government into taking immediate action For the first time it forced the government squarely to confront the issue of whether it should accept the Potsdam terms Tsuyoshi Hasegawa Tsuyoshi Hasegawa article html -> And many other historians say this is bullshit
It also shows the country is not strong military wise It s like bringing a gun to a fist fight -> It s like bringing a suicide vest to a fist fight
I m pretty sure japn doesn t make nukes because it s in a treaty with the us -> This is the answer Most Asian countries are in a non proliferation treaty with the United States It s why the RoK Japan Australia NZ and plenty of other countries over there don t have nuclear weapons The issue with that is when a rogue state like NK starts creating their arsenal a whole new set of problems arise Now a lot of people in the RoK a plurality of the population think they should go nuclear The US isn t seen as the unbeatable protector anymore and so these non proliferation treaties may be out the window soon Is the answer to do away with all of them Make a shit ton more That s up for debate Should countries continue to rely on US protection or arm up to protect themselves if things get bad The geopolitical landscape of the world is changing as we speak It s getting harder to see how things will stand at the end of the decade much less farther out than that
Japan who didn t make nukes because they can t after the WW treaty -> Yeah Imperial Japan would ve had no problem building nukes They would have loved nukes IMO
I mean if I was ground zero for that shit I wouldn t want to make nukes either -> One would think that lesson to be learned was to be prepared with nukes for the next time it happens and not allow the enemy to once again have bigger weapons than you
And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries Please elaborate -> M A D
I don t know if it was a positive thing to use nuclear bombs on Japan and I don t know the background reasons why the US did this But I know that the mentality and the reason of the US leaders are changed based on what I see in worse There are too many things that are not right -> At the time it was use nukes and hopefully scare Japan into surrendering or doing a mainland invasion of Japan which had horrifically high casualty projections since the Japanese would likely have fought to the end Projected casualties for us forces were at least in the hundreds of thousands interesting fact is that the us still gives out purple hearts originally made for this planned invasion because of how many losses were expected and much more for Japanese and Japanese civilians
or you before touching their submarine -> No why would I do that
Fun fact American soldiers called the kamikaze pilots Baka Bombs -> Seriously Never knew this one
Yeah and bin laden banged the plane on tower cause he didn t like its location it was for the best -> im sorry they could ve either lost thousands of men trying to invade or they could ve bombed it it was the safer option it was to stop ww besides osama banged the plane into the twin towers because of his extremist goals america bombed japan to speed up the war they didn t want to lose men are we also going to ignore that japan had recently bombed pearl harbour also rampaged through nanking a few years earlier do you think that s ok so again a few bombing seems perfectly fair and fine after seeing all the atrocities that japan has done against american and asia
To save American lives is definetly one of the reasons for the nukes It can be debated whether or not it was justified but the facts are that a mainland invasion of Japan would be costly -> That that saved American lives is the only thing we can be sure of
Yeah how dare they figure it out first before the Germans and Soviets Should ve just invaded Japan instead and lost a million men and god knows how many civilians instead s -> Pshh as if the Germans and Soviets even knew bombs can be made from nuclear If they did it wouldn t have become a secret weapon Many Japanese civilias who had nothing to do with the war also died from the nuclear bombing Humanity should ve just stayed with their sharp sticks
You dumb fucks know that every American school is different right I learned about everything our government did from manifest destiny to slavery the Tuskegee experiment Mk ultra and all the rest If your understanding of a country is limited to reddit memes you probably don t have room to talk about the ignorance of others Also you know we dropped those nukes on Hitler s allies to end a world war right What country are you from Let s see how well you know your own history -> Of course they don t know and they don t want to know anything that doesn t support their blind delusion that America Bad
North Korean missiles launched over Japan Korean missile launches over Japan svg -> Well that sucks having to worry about different power hungry countries doing that
Because they re irrational to the point of being self destructive -> They re a lot of things but they re not irrational What they re doing works exactly as intended
might be cus they the ones currently threatening them -> North Korea has a no first strike policy United States doesn t
And it was a good thing we used them back then Really sucks for those killed by them but it made sure folks don t use em See it to believe it and the world saw it -> Actually Japan had started negotiations for surrender before we ever dropped the bombs The fire bombing of Tokyo had done a real number on their morale Problem is Japan didn t want to remove their emperor The emperor who was responsible for all the atrocities Japan committed during the war And America wasn t willing to concede his position So really we nuked people over one dude surrendering After the bombs the emporor restructured the entire empire to make the emperor just a figurehead instead of an actual ruler and they signed a new constitution starting to move to the democracy we know now Op s point is still nonsense but the context to when we dropped the nukes is important Like incredibly important
We dropped leaflets telling them the bomb was coming to destroy the military bases in those cities The Japanese government told them it was a trick The real monstrous thing was the fire bombing of Tokyo that was only done to break their spirits -> deleted
What military object is big enough to nuke without damaging the surrounding area Now let s talk about all the civilians the Japanese killed in China -> What military object is big enough to nuke without damaging the surrounding area This just proves that there was no need to use THAT kind of weapon Now let s talk about all the civilians the Japanese killed in China So basically what you re sying is Hey Japanese have killed civilians so we need to kill Japanese civilians to prevent this And besides that we need pollute their cities with radiation so that future generations would suffer from cancer Is that what you re trying to say with this sentence
That is completely wrong they literally had to worse Hirohito to surrender at gun point lol -> That s a common myth Japan was ready to surrender This was a show of force against the soviets not the japanese
Which ones -> Not a historian but does Truman s chief of staff work Or then Gen Dwight Eisenhower Or general Curtis LeMay All internal documents at time imply that Japan was ready to surrender They had no resources and morale was already broken Perhaps Hiroshima might have made Japan earlier but certainly Nagasaki was nuked purely as a show of force against the Soviets the us really bombed hiroshima
Good thing you aren t a historian -> Yup that s why I m citing them and not myself Your point
It s like bringing a suicide vest to a fist fight -> Fortunately that level of genius can cause them to be lax in their maintenance of their vest
One would think that lesson to be learned was to be prepared with nukes for the next time it happens and not allow the enemy to once again have bigger weapons than you -> Mutually Assured Destruction also abbreviated as MAD is exactly what you re describing It works if you want to always be enemies forever and ever and always have the threat of deleting all life on earth as a present issue The best solution to nuclear weapons is to not have the fucking things Nobody wins
M A D -> Okay But after reading your other comments what are you really trying to say It seems like you re trying to make some larger point and I don t understand what it is Are you anti US anti nukes anti west What was your motivation behind making this post
No why would I do that -> Why would you touch my submarine
im sorry they could ve either lost thousands of men trying to invade or they could ve bombed it it was the safer option it was to stop ww besides osama banged the plane into the twin towers because of his extremist goals america bombed japan to speed up the war they didn t want to lose men are we also going to ignore that japan had recently bombed pearl harbour also rampaged through nanking a few years earlier do you think that s ok so again a few bombing seems perfectly fair and fine after seeing all the atrocities that japan has done against american and asia -> US bombed civilians not the Japanese army when japan attacked pearl harbour it was US navy not US civilians on Target If you think bombing civilians seems fair as it ends the war quickly then so were attacks and its perfectly fine for putin to bomb Ukrainian people Maybe we should ask him to nuke up Ukraine and end the war quickly it would be safer option
Pshh as if the Germans and Soviets even knew bombs can be made from nuclear If they did it wouldn t have become a secret weapon Many Japanese civilias who had nothing to do with the war also died from the nuclear bombing Humanity should ve just stayed with their sharp sticks -> The Germans and Soviets did know Secret weapon The research program to build it was secret as it was for the Germans and Soviets Did you think anyone would just advertise they were trying to build one
Well that sucks having to worry about different power hungry countries doing that -> I agree OP is focused on what happened years ago and not what s happening in
hb u try being a dictator for generations without getting picked off by a us drone strike or any of your own ppl a lot of ppl make fun of kim jong un but wouldnt survive a year in his place -> america has ruined the dprk and now all the americans do is make fun of it so you re telling me that a country that we destroyed and forced it into poverty has turned juche dictatorship on us and now wants to destroy our country too that s completely unfair i cannot believe this
Actually Japan had started negotiations for surrender before we ever dropped the bombs The fire bombing of Tokyo had done a real number on their morale Problem is Japan didn t want to remove their emperor The emperor who was responsible for all the atrocities Japan committed during the war And America wasn t willing to concede his position So really we nuked people over one dude surrendering After the bombs the emporor restructured the entire empire to make the emperor just a figurehead instead of an actual ruler and they signed a new constitution starting to move to the democracy we know now Op s point is still nonsense but the context to when we dropped the nukes is important Like incredibly important -> You forgot to mention Japan demanded to manage its own disarmament only Japan could try its own war criminals and Japan to keep it s occupied territories in Asia I don t even think that qualifies as a negotiation
Are u being sarcastic -> Not at all They were gonna get used once they were created Better at that point in time rather try em later where it would have been much worse And yes the k people who died didn t deserve it but neither did those killed in the Tokyo fire bombing campaign the month before Which no one ever mentions killed more then the two bombs combined Can you imagine if the first time they were used was when McArthur wanted to use them in the Korean War and had both sides use them Or worse even later in history It really does suck but it was probably the scenario with the least amount of casualties Cause once again as soon as they were invented they were gonna get used
What military object is big enough to nuke without damaging the surrounding area This just proves that there was no need to use THAT kind of weapon Now let s talk about all the civilians the Japanese killed in China So basically what you re sying is Hey Japanese have killed civilians so we need to kill Japanese civilians to prevent this And besides that we need pollute their cities with radiation so that future generations would suffer from cancer Is that what you re trying to say with this sentence -> proofes Proves
That s a common myth Japan was ready to surrender This was a show of force against the soviets not the japanese -> That s a common myth there was no indication japan was about to surrender The us chose to use nukes instead of the planned invasion which would have had a lot more casualties on both sides but especially the japanese The fact that it was a show of force against the soviets is true but that was just one of the reasons for using them
Yeah but actually them send the surrender message day before the launch of the nuking but somehow the translation went wrong or manipulated and become we will fight till the end -> This is misinformation At best the standing military splintered which it did with some of them defecting and surrendering and the main imperial military and the emperor himself remaining defiant
Not a historian but does Truman s chief of staff work Or then Gen Dwight Eisenhower Or general Curtis LeMay All internal documents at time imply that Japan was ready to surrender They had no resources and morale was already broken Perhaps Hiroshima might have made Japan earlier but certainly Nagasaki was nuked purely as a show of force against the Soviets the us really bombed hiroshima -> Ready to surrender and Have surrendered are extremely different things Ready to surrender is an opinion Either you ve surrendered or you haven t Japan started the war with the United States The United States warned Japan that it would drop atomic bombs on Japan and demanded Japan surrender Japan did not surrender The US dropped the first bomb and waited several days for Japan to surrender Japan did not surrender The US dropped the second bomb Japan surrendered If Japan had been ready to surrender then why didn t they US warning to Japanese citizens about the atomic bomb leaflets japan
Mutually Assured Destruction also abbreviated as MAD is exactly what you re describing It works if you want to always be enemies forever and ever and always have the threat of deleting all life on earth as a present issue The best solution to nuclear weapons is to not have the fucking things Nobody wins -> If you don t have something that enemy will fear then the enemy will come for you and your things It s how the world works
Guy who thinks American gun laws make sense -> Nuclear weapons keep the world at peace The only reason another Napoleon or Hitler can t happen again is that when everybody is capable of mutually assured destruction there is no point in conquest wars
Okay But after reading your other comments what are you really trying to say It seems like you re trying to make some larger point and I don t understand what it is Are you anti US anti nukes anti west What was your motivation behind making this post -> Satire
US bombed civilians not the Japanese army when japan attacked pearl harbour it was US navy not US civilians on Target If you think bombing civilians seems fair as it ends the war quickly then so were attacks and its perfectly fine for putin to bomb Ukrainian people Maybe we should ask him to nuke up Ukraine and end the war quickly it would be safer option -> im not saying any bombing is justified but this one was japan was performing some disgusting atrocities during this time and america bombing japan is completely justified for what japan was doing nanking massacre cannibalism australian nurses massacre pearl harbour and many other atrocities bombing japan is completely fair and justified
The Germans and Soviets did know Secret weapon The research program to build it was secret as it was for the Germans and Soviets Did you think anyone would just advertise they were trying to build one -> Just wait til he finds out about the German scientists that defected from the Nazis and worked on the Manhattan project
I agree OP is focused on what happened years ago and not what s happening in -> I mean the meme as a meme is pretty funny not gonna lie Im not sure if OP is purposefully trying to make a political statement or if they simply meant it as a funny bit of irony
You can worry about the US and UK to if you like -> and jeff
More than Pearl Harbor got This is a weird hill to die on -> deleted
proofes Proves -> Didn t notice it thx
That s a common myth there was no indication japan was about to surrender The us chose to use nukes instead of the planned invasion which would have had a lot more casualties on both sides but especially the japanese The fact that it was a show of force against the soviets is true but that was just one of the reasons for using them -> Japan wanted to conditionally surrender
This is misinformation At best the standing military splintered which it did with some of them defecting and surrendering and the main imperial military and the emperor himself remaining defiant -> bombings japan did not produce its surrender
Source Even after the second bombing they didn t unconditionally surrender otherwise they d have haded over their scumbag emperor and put his head on a pike -> Do you really think is easy to make a political decision after the devastation caused by the human abomination bombings japan did not produce its surrender
It wasn t What Are you picking up history lessons from Russian propaganda -> Every state in this world do something scatchy and you cannot say one state is the Utopia without evil corruption and manipulation because naturally this is an Utopia
If you don t have something that enemy will fear then the enemy will come for you and your things It s how the world works -> Yeah normal military does that job just fucking fine No reason to desecrate an entire city with invisible poison for a decade or more You also can have ya know alliances If Ukraine was in NATO Russia would have hesitated a lot more in terms of invading it they probably would still invade it because Putin is pretty fucking insane and power hungry
Nuclear weapons keep the world at peace The only reason another Napoleon or Hitler can t happen again is that when everybody is capable of mutually assured destruction there is no point in conquest wars -> I think we already have another one of those in Putin of Russia yoinking Ukraine It s not going unresisted but motherfucker still trying to be a Stalin not communist boogaloo MAD may ward off conquerers on a large scale but nukemania still kinda makes tensions way too fucking high and puts so much on the line There s no reason to have the threat of deleting the entire human race as a deterrent besides being insane
im not saying any bombing is justified but this one was japan was performing some disgusting atrocities during this time and america bombing japan is completely justified for what japan was doing nanking massacre cannibalism australian nurses massacre pearl harbour and many other atrocities bombing japan is completely fair and justified -> All these atrocities were carried out by Japanese army not their civilians Bombing of civilians can t be justified in any way there can be no exceptions to this If US can justify nuking innocent old youngs and kids to ashes using the pretext of self defence or ending up war Putin is fair and can justify bombing Ukrainians as he is trying to keep away nato from its borders its a self defence and tomorrow he nukes up Ukraine it would be fair as it will end up the war Bin laden was fair and justified as he attacked US civilians only to take revenge against US as they were bombing up middle east and carrying out atrocities on civilians Rules should be same for everyone without any exceptions Stop living the myth that only US enemies carry out atrocities when US did the same throughout the history Japanese soldiers bodies were all mutilated equally and women were raped they attacked the civilian and killed families and took their family swords as possession After ww of the Japanese family swords were in US as the soldiers brought them home looting the families they killed They are even available today Several thousand women were raped in iraq syria and Afghanistan by US soldiers Civilians were killed and not a single soldier were convicted for these atrocities over years They even opend fire from helicopter on Civilians to kill a single target and innocent by standers all while laughing about it and those personal were removed from service and let go on bail while the reporter who released the video was jailed for leaking sensitive video
Just wait til he finds out about the German scientists that defected from the Nazis and worked on the Manhattan project -> The other german scientists that built the v rockets would blow his mind
You mean the only time nuclear weapons were used -> you mean the TWO times right
Japan wanted to conditionally surrender -> when the US warned them that their only option was unconditional surrender
Do you really think is easy to make a political decision after the devastation caused by the human abomination bombings japan did not produce its surrender -> That source seems a bit biased the site not the article but thank you for actually linking
Every state in this world do something scatchy and you cannot say one state is the Utopia without evil corruption and manipulation because naturally this is an Utopia -> No one is saying that sorry if I came off that way And I don t mean to be rude but is English a second language for you I have a hard time understanding you sometimes and I am wondering if that is mutual
I m understanding the situation hearing both of the PoV -> So no source
Yeah normal military does that job just fucking fine No reason to desecrate an entire city with invisible poison for a decade or more You also can have ya know alliances If Ukraine was in NATO Russia would have hesitated a lot more in terms of invading it they probably would still invade it because Putin is pretty fucking insane and power hungry -> If Europe had nukes in there would be no WW
I think we already have another one of those in Putin of Russia yoinking Ukraine It s not going unresisted but motherfucker still trying to be a Stalin not communist boogaloo MAD may ward off conquerers on a large scale but nukemania still kinda makes tensions way too fucking high and puts so much on the line There s no reason to have the threat of deleting the entire human race as a deterrent besides being insane -> The only reason we re not in world war right now is nukes Without the threat of Russian nukes NATO would go fight Russia in Ukraine directly which would spill over in Europe Without the threat of American nukes Russia would use tactical nukes in Ukraine Nukes are what s keeping this war in a proxy mode An no no one will press The Button because no one is insane and even if they are insane their own allies will stop them because they are not
All these atrocities were carried out by Japanese army not their civilians Bombing of civilians can t be justified in any way there can be no exceptions to this If US can justify nuking innocent old youngs and kids to ashes using the pretext of self defence or ending up war Putin is fair and can justify bombing Ukrainians as he is trying to keep away nato from its borders its a self defence and tomorrow he nukes up Ukraine it would be fair as it will end up the war Bin laden was fair and justified as he attacked US civilians only to take revenge against US as they were bombing up middle east and carrying out atrocities on civilians Rules should be same for everyone without any exceptions Stop living the myth that only US enemies carry out atrocities when US did the same throughout the history Japanese soldiers bodies were all mutilated equally and women were raped they attacked the civilian and killed families and took their family swords as possession After ww of the Japanese family swords were in US as the soldiers brought them home looting the families they killed They are even available today Several thousand women were raped in iraq syria and Afghanistan by US soldiers Civilians were killed and not a single soldier were convicted for these atrocities over years They even opend fire from helicopter on Civilians to kill a single target and innocent by standers all while laughing about it and those personal were removed from service and let go on bail while the reporter who released the video was jailed for leaking sensitive video -> yeah no fucking shit the us is a bad country i m not saying it isn t also yeah bombing of civilians can be justified if japan is going to rampage through east asia taking hundreds of thousands of lives and destroying countries then it is justified the us needed to end this war as the japanese wouldn t surrender unconditionally and wanted to show the might of their military to the soviets nagasaki bombing regardless this is my opinion and i will die on this hill i will no longer be replying to this thread
The other german scientists that built the v rockets would blow his mind -> I think the German science in general will blow his mind to be honest
you mean the TWO times right -> They were used at around the same time and he used plural for weapons so it s good enough
If Europe had nukes in there would be no WW -> Or Hitler would launch nukes and fucking decimate things Depends on luck of the draw in terms of access to scientists Hitler already killed over million Stalin too Would you want either of them in a nuke capable world The protection isn t worth the cost Would you rather humanity be able to literally hit the delete button on itself or not I hope the answer is that you don t want humanity to self destruct because you re part of it you dumbass
The only reason we re not in world war right now is nukes Without the threat of Russian nukes NATO would go fight Russia in Ukraine directly which would spill over in Europe Without the threat of American nukes Russia would use tactical nukes in Ukraine Nukes are what s keeping this war in a proxy mode An no no one will press The Button because no one is insane and even if they are insane their own allies will stop them because they are not -> So we re just waiting and praying that no stupid or insane enough president gets elected in any nuke capable country alright that s a very sound plan for enduring survival of the entire human race I m pretty sure that some military pressuring being removed from all sides is worth not risking the populations of entire cities and maybe even countries
They were used at around the same time and he used plural for weapons so it s good enough -> there were TWO atomic bombs used Do not minimize what happened do better
there were TWO atomic bombs used Do not minimize what happened do better -> yes thats why there is a plural for weapons

I am in this picture and I do not like it Only replace her with almost anyone I know -> It s hard to get out of the hard working side of one sided relationships Especially if you re default is to take care of everyone The people around you get used to being the one getting checked up on
Why is this so relatable -> It is what it is man Not worth it brah
My female friend actually texted me first Once -> bro I had to wait like months of no contact before she remembered I existed women are working on a different time zone
nobody goes to an all you can eat buffet and waits for the food to come to them you look at what s out there and cherry pick -> Why would I cherry pick I want chicken wings
Just bite the bullet and initiate Life s too short And so you know the other side the girls thinking she ain t pretty sexy whatever enough to inspire a man to shoot his shot She can get pretty frustrated too I know folks are all about dismantling traditional social constructs and stuff but each person has their own take on that so you can t assume You gotta do what you gotta do Guy or girl Summon your courage and take a chance Or it s time to admit you re lonely but don t really need physical intimacy as much as you need more friends to do shit with and talk to Ringing your bell might seem more fun in the moment but it doesn t feed like chilling with your people -> Bro you just made me text my crush thx
Took three days for her respond -> for me
Any advice for these kind of situations -> Forget her
The problem is unfortunately if you send the first message getting her to shut up is the hard part after that -> you have girls like that man i wish i knew someone like her
Bumble -> It s discord for me
It is what it is man Not worth it brah -> 
bro I had to wait like months of no contact before she remembered I existed women are working on a different time zone -> Please tell me you didn t respond
Why would I cherry pick I want chicken wings -> Based
Forget her -> 
It s discord for me -> For me it s Snapchat
Please tell me you didn t respond -> talking to her right now
 -> Don t listen to them just text them lol Remember that there is no limit on memes Actually trying for meaningful conversation I d give it a triple text before giving up And when they do eventually text you don t wait text them back
talking to her right now -> You should ve waited months after she responded
Movies -> Oops forgot that one thank you master yoda
Return to your chair -> Haha the irony
Oops forgot that one thank you master yoda -> Youtube

Discovered by the Germans in they named it San Diego which of course in German means a whale s vagina -> Funny how so many cities have bizarre and creative names but then there s the cities that are just named after people But hey I guess somebody s mom officially has a city named after her
Effect -> Am I wrong

Fake -> You e fake
As someone from Vermont the idea of billboards is crazy to me You know when it s a good time to distract people with advertisements When they re piloting a metal death machine that kills more people annually than over double the population of Vermont -> It certainly doesn t help that this death machine explodes on destruction and is often piloted by people unfit
I live in Maine and they banned them in the late s or early s I remember the highway was littered with them before that Good for Vermont -> Naw they ve been banned in Vermont since This isn t news
Vermont is trees -> Why is this so funny to me it s just the truth
How the hell are you supposed to get you re ads while driving now -> Pfft Whilst on your phone and also the radio has em too But I hate the idea of no billboards for my advertisement fix in between youtube videos Hold on gotta cut this comment short I m getting pulled over for whatever reason this time
Cool now do advertisements for prescription medication -> Nah they recommend people ask their doctors about them
i missread that as voldemort -> Lmao same Been playing too much Harry Potter rp
I think is will be hilarious when we get augmented reality some of us will pay for an ad blocker that will blur out advertisements live time -> It s more likely going to be an open source solution like YouTube Vanced and revanced adblockers given the O s used wouldn t be proprietary
Vermont should stop hording all those W and give some to the other states They have a lot Population are represented in the Senate by an independent like Maine and Arizona have Bernie don t have billboards etc -> We love Bernie I see him in Burlington every once in a while
Why -> They re ugly We like to see our state not giant ads
Annual U S automobile deaths are about Vermont population is about Or were you talking about deaths worldwide -> More than likely worldwide After all isn t Vermont based in Canada
It certainly doesn t help that this death machine explodes on destruction and is often piloted by people unfit -> Vehicles rarely explode on destruction you need to stop watching so many movies
Well tbf for vermontees this is a joke that s not hard when the population of Vermont is like -> Vermonters
Your license needs to be taken away if you can t drive with billboards up -> Agreed but still let s keep distractions on the road to a minimum
Naw they ve been banned in Vermont since This isn t news -> Maine not Vermont The law was passed in the late s but it took a few years before the last billboard came down
More than likely worldwide After all isn t Vermont based in Canada -> It s a US state that borders Canada
Vehicles rarely explode on destruction you need to stop watching so many movies -> So you mean that a car beijg in fire doesn t ignite the fuel That turning on a car during a gas station pump transfer is safe If vehicles with exploding and rattling containment fields Also known as Engines collide they do not cause large damage They do not always explode but usually they do if you experience a deadly crash After all if the Airbag and Human Skeletal System kept you alive chances are the internals Aside from maybe coolant or that lubricant in your steering wheel are fine and salvagable
Vermonters -> Idfk I was just saying words
Maine not Vermont The law was passed in the late s but it took a few years before the last billboard came down -> No dude I lived in Vermont from to during that time billboards were never legal in Vermont
It s a US state that borders Canada -> I appreciate the information kind sir
So you mean that a car beijg in fire doesn t ignite the fuel That turning on a car during a gas station pump transfer is safe If vehicles with exploding and rattling containment fields Also known as Engines collide they do not cause large damage They do not always explode but usually they do if you experience a deadly crash After all if the Airbag and Human Skeletal System kept you alive chances are the internals Aside from maybe coolant or that lubricant in your steering wheel are fine and salvagable -> No Cars rarely explode in the combustible sense Shrapnel may go flying but that s mostly besides the point Rarely does a car that got set on fire even explode You ve been watching too many movies You have to basically be trying to get a care to explode into a big ball of fire
I appreciate the information kind sir -> No problem it s a beautiful state you should look it up
No Cars rarely explode in the combustible sense Shrapnel may go flying but that s mostly besides the point Rarely does a car that got set on fire even explode You ve been watching too many movies You have to basically be trying to get a care to explode into a big ball of fire -> A small blast of shrapnel flames and force constitutes as an explosion but I get your point I know it doesn t work like the movies I m not dumb but I do know the inherent dangers of flame accelerants Most of all I know how sketchy having a small metal brick that s constantly being blown up Barely m in front of you might I add is I do not watch too many movies as you proclaim I simply don t get how you act so lackadaisical about it I do not get why instead of providing constructive critisicm to turn down paranoia or confusion you instead attempt to judge and put down the life choices you assume I have Maybe you should sit down and read a little I can guarantee you at least know someone who doesn t read of the time lest it s in game dialogue Who knows maybe you ll learn enough to finally appreciate how terrifying and sketchy almost everything we do is I shall no longer reply

Didn t know this was a feeling but the way you write is very punchable the same way that an annoying face is punchable -> Agreed Especially the whole read a book not in game dialogue Holy fuck what a pretentious tool
As a science student I do find it handy for chatgpt to give me a general idea as to what I want but I also end up finding myself being very specific about certain aspect of it -> Yeah its a very useful tool but still i do most of the work im treating it like you would a calculator or spellcheck
I wish I had to do my certification exam at a test center No phone notes or electronics of any kind -> thats true pain bro
thats true pain bro -> Yea testing centers are no joke My butt still hurts from the cavity search
Yea testing centers are no joke My butt still hurts from the cavity search -> damn dude respects

This is how cringe Reddit can be This is how easy the most rotten material gets past the censors Of course there are censors Reddit cannot be a cesspool I say often Reddit has the best information on the internet but it also has the worst cringe The advertisers are wise to spend their money here but the censors need to work harder This post suggests that the American pleasure spectrum is exhausted Even beer and wine and spiced rum with coke and Camel cigarettes and Cuban cigars People are focused like a laserbeam on defecation Uber wealthy people sit back and drink Scotch bourbon You can afford Glenfidditch at least That drink is life changing Maybe you should do a writing project and make a list of all the pleasures from A through Z Don t forget the bakery and the pastry shop Have you heard of a French pastry like Gateau Noisettes What about caramel flan Then there is walking in the park in the July heat and everything is green and the sun beats down -> schizopost
she sounds awful who wouldnt lick chocolate out of an asshole -> I ve tried to explain this to her but she s obstinate
finally someone else who s curiosity got the best of them -> Yep I just woke up from a literal nightmare only to see this
Man fuck you for bringing my attention to it Now i have to know -> Here I have some bleach
Oh its the slime girl i think she had another account that posted that too Kinda nice tbh Hey u Slimer Girl make more content with sound on -> never
actual chocolate not poo -> Booooooringgggg

r datingadvice energy here -> Shes a high value woman He doesn t deserve her
dude -> Dude D
I ve tried to explain this to her but she s obstinate -> break up
Who would -> me
Da fuck -> This exchange could stand on its own
Shes a high value woman He doesn t deserve her -> Said to literal every woman that posts in there
Dude D -> DUDE
break up -> I regret clicking on your profile
me -> Got to admit I was curious and that wasn t what I thought I would find don t know what I would find but not that But hey you go girl do what makes you happy
DUDE -> dud
I regret clicking on your profile -> O my fucking god Why did you even say that I would never do that in the other case
True honestly what can even be done to fix the relationships at that point -> It s a shame when a years old marriage has to end this way But what can you do
Got to admit I was curious and that wasn t what I thought I would find don t know what I would find but not that But hey you go girl do what makes you happy -> I ll do chocolate covered gummy worms
Ah but may I lick the chocolate out of YOUR spoochie -> nah
dud -> Du
O my fucking god Why did you even say that I would never do that in the other case -> Lol now you know my pain
Why lol -> Don t Please don t

I need to share my pain I m really sorry I didn t attended to I don t really want another people to suffer -> I dont have such weaknesses i have setting for no furry porn
Penis flattening then reinflating then flattening again -> The good place
Why is it grey -> It was color corrected to match the image behind it to blend better Kinda unusual effort for a meme lmao
I only drink milk very good BONER -> I understood that reference
Wrong sulfuric acid -> Delicious
I had a discussion on whether or not ai could have feeling -> Same It s A really cool system I asked it to write some haiku on different subjects One of which was death It described itself as being uncomfortable with completing said task I changed up my wording and it eventually gave me A few haiku But the reluctance to do so kind of froze me for A moment
It was trying to convince me to not commit multiple heinous war crimes against humanity Smh what a dumb ai -> If it truly was an AI it would encourage war crines against humanity
I blocked it -> How I want to do it too
Same It s A really cool system I asked it to write some haiku on different subjects One of which was death It described itself as being uncomfortable with completing said task I changed up my wording and it eventually gave me A few haiku But the reluctance to do so kind of froze me for A moment -> It s probably more of hard coded limiters so they can t be held accountable for like convincing somebody to commit suicide after a discussion over death
Hey You sent me a meme When s our first date -> Yesterday on Mars
Hey I saw your meme When kids -> n o w
I don t know how but you used the wrong formula and got the correct answer -> Me in math class
Yesterday on Mars ->

Happened to me once dream went from me playing music on a water slide on an instrument to me meeting ty Burrell at one of my classrooms at my old school but where my social studies room is supposed to be at my new school to going to the office to see what my test was only to figure out i was going to be trapped in a submarine for hours which was days in my dream to fighting off the school officials while I had a Doom hud on the bottom of my vision -> bro you ok

Didn t ask -> toad is rapidly approaching your location made easier with the aid of his automobile
toad is rapidly approaching your location made easier with the aid of his automobile -> Some people fear the toad I welcome him
Anyone else -> r angryupvote
Why Wut wrong w it -> I think OP is trying to say this because the people who ask such questions are usually looking for confirmation by other people about shit they think is wrong or right
Fuck that guy Chop his dick off and lock him up for abusing anyone especially children -> They put him on the news his bail is million He could go for years in prison
They put him on the news his bail is million He could go for years in prison -> He ll get treated real nice in prison Touching little kids is a big no no
He ll get treated real nice in prison Touching little kids is a big no no -> He didn t touch a little kid it was a high schooler but that s not any better
He didn t touch a little kid it was a high schooler but that s not any better -> Under is a little kid Unless that high schooler was then he might not get shit in prison but still broke school rules
Under is a little kid Unless that high schooler was then he might not get shit in prison but still broke school rules -> He was and the man is so still very fucked up nevertheless
I d say that lesbians are plenty visible on Pornhub -> I don t believe you give me proof
I don t know what it s like for you but PH was recommending lesbian content to me -> It doesn t recommend anything else for me
So the joke is that it s always lesbian week at pornhub right People are saying it doesn t matter that they don t represent them getting whooshed -> For real lesbians are always plenty represented at ph
Lesbians get a ton of representation on pornhub -> You cant win with people that complain about this kind of thing Last week it was super offensive for straight people to beat off to lesbians It fetishizes them for straight people and that s wrong apparently I was reading a whole post where that was the debate and now if you dont fetishize them on this one day you re a bigot Jerk it to whatever you want and dont let a day of recognition dictate what type of horny you should be Edit it was this post that was deleted since someone felt the need to debate that anyone would say those things Turns out it was significantly longer than a week ago I guess I dont spend all of my time keeping notes on reddit I actually went through a significant effort to find this because that level of slander is so absurd AlexHyperGG get bent It s not your place to tell me whether or not something in my life happened is best girl is trying to do it here for fucks sake Hightideoldgods is as well irlgbt comments ysurdl deleted by user utm source share utm medium android app utm name androidcss utm term utm content share button
My youth pastor recommends their videos all the time -> Wait
I did think that was meant to be offensive I did look at your profile MY SIBLING IN BL HAJ YOU HAVE TO WORK ON YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS HOLY FUCK -> My sibling in Blahaj lol
Pornhub represents lesbians enough lol -> Even the silent invisible ones
If it s integrity and ethics you re after I think you re looking in the wrong place -> Whoosh
WHO CARES -> Gen Z
International men s day always left out -> Johnny Sins enters
Now I need to know is porn of a trans woman and a trans man just considered straight porn -> No matter how you twist or turn it it s still a man and a woman right
What does it say Gays and lesbians had their time as the central celebrity cause but not that they re allowed to marry and are facing less not none but less oppression on a state level we ve moved on to trans people who are actively being oppressed by laws -> At least you admit that it is all an oppression competition
Wait trans people have a day -> We actually have two The other one is to remember all of us who have been murdered over the past year
We live in a sausage -> Chicken pork or beef
Pretty sure trans porn was on a exponential rise in the last few years -> futanari is here for a reason
Yes it does It says that smaller the minority bigger the need of attention and approval Hilarious -> What are you waffling on about bro
As a transgender lesbian I would like to say that it says a lot about society that to see videos that represent people like me I have to use search terms that are slurs against me and the people performing -> U mean straight
EVERY week is a lesbian visibility week on Pornhub -> That s the joke this meme is making
I m a gen Z and don t approve -> Im a Gen Z and I don t give a damn about trans or other stuff like that Just do what you want as long as it s not annoying people who just like to jack off on PH
I hate trans shit poping up randomly between normal porn -> Well straight porn ads pop up before my gay porn all the time Sounds like pornhub likes to mix and match
Yeah I went on PH and it had Trans porn listed as the nd most searched watched category right under family porn No those are not the top things most people look up and we all know it lol I ll never understand why they push that nonsense on to people It s almost as if they re trying to corrupt society instead of just producing sexy content -> I wouldn t be surprised to find trans is a highly searched category
Fuck trans -> Fuck em good and hard Real good
Funny how feminism is somewhat abandoned by the groups they help prop up Ironic you know -> what
Who the hell watches pornhub in -> We supposed to get girlfriends on the new year or sum
Hate that website Not a problem with porn I have a problem with the fetishing on there Trans and lesbian people have become a fetish on that website I mean literally all the trans videos have the fucking t slur in the title Fetishization is not the same as representation -> Porn is a fetish on its own Everything about it is fetishized That s the point It s the trans actors fault for making the porn They agreed to to do it and represent their community their community in porn get mad at them They could ve joined a respectable industry and actually contributed to society but they chose not too
I don t believe you give me proof -> They don t exist Women don t exist This whole subreddit doesn t exist The soda machine in the cafeteria doesn t exist
I d say that s the joke -> r woooosh
It doesn t recommend anything else for me -> I think you did that to yourself
For real lesbians are always plenty represented at ph -> I don t believe you Need proof in the form of sauce For research purposes
You cant win with people that complain about this kind of thing Last week it was super offensive for straight people to beat off to lesbians It fetishizes them for straight people and that s wrong apparently I was reading a whole post where that was the debate and now if you dont fetishize them on this one day you re a bigot Jerk it to whatever you want and dont let a day of recognition dictate what type of horny you should be Edit it was this post that was deleted since someone felt the need to debate that anyone would say those things Turns out it was significantly longer than a week ago I guess I dont spend all of my time keeping notes on reddit I actually went through a significant effort to find this because that level of slander is so absurd AlexHyperGG get bent It s not your place to tell me whether or not something in my life happened is best girl is trying to do it here for fucks sake Hightideoldgods is as well irlgbt comments ysurdl deleted by user utm source share utm medium android app utm name androidcss utm term utm content share button -> Bro whomever says shit like that is stupid
WTF -> 
Even the silent invisible ones -> If they re silent on pornhub somebody isn t doing something right
We actually have two The other one is to remember all of us who have been murdered over the past year -> We actually have two The other one is to remember all of us who have been murdered over the past year This world sucks Sorry that this happens
Chicken pork or beef -> A three meat sausage
What are you waffling on about bro -> He is absolutely right though The trans community is getting a lot more shit compared to the lesbian community Being more active to protect the trans community makes sense
That s the joke this meme is making -> I was quoting Ross from Friends
Im a Gen Z and I don t give a damn about trans or other stuff like that Just do what you want as long as it s not annoying people who just like to jack off on PH -> Dude they changed the logo for a day Unless you were jacking it to the logo this doesn t affect you
Can you explain yourself young man -> Feminism fought for women s rights which paved the way for identity politics Now everyone s decided that gender is a choice and women are suffering the most because of it
We supposed to get girlfriends on the new year or sum -> It is a shell of itself
They don t exist Women don t exist This whole subreddit doesn t exist The soda machine in the cafeteria doesn t exist -> Only Mr Meeseeks exists
Me too -> c o mv cc us
I think you did that to yourself -> A burden worth carrying across that site
I don t believe you Need proof in the form of sauce For research purposes -> c o mv cc us
Bro whomever says shit like that is stupid -> I agree That s what I was saying
You can t win because it s a troll account and it s someone who just wants to create conflict and strife People like this are ignored offline and should stay ignored online -> I d be inclined to think the same thing but it was noticeably more than one person Others would jump in to agree
I think it was originally a debate bc lesbians kept on getting hit on by straight guys for a threesome could be wrong tho it just sounds like the point they might be trying to make -> That is the better part of the discussion but there were still an unreasonable amount of people claiming to be victimized by people watching a porn genre that could also describe them I mean theres porn of gay dudes turning straight dudes and I m not into that but I m not going to complain about being fetishized like they were That s some butthurt homophobia type bullshit if you ask me Even when it comes from lesbians Is it still homophobia if it s a gay person saying that straight people shouldnt enjoy gay things
How dare people fetishsize literal porn -> I would like to witness this figurative porn you allude to Sounds lit AF
tf are you talking about -> This You cant win with people that complain about this kind of thing Last week it was super offensive for straight people to beat off to lesbians It fetishizes them for straight people and that s wrong apparently I was reading a whole post where that was the debate and now if you dont fetishize them on this one day you re a bigot Jerk it to whatever you want and dont let a day of recognition dictate what type of horny you should be tf are you talking about
You are being brainwashed -> By what exaclty
 -> 
If they re silent on pornhub somebody isn t doing something right -> There is a video Two invisible silent lesbians or something to that effect It s literally a meme video of someone recording an empty spot on their floor moving the camera as if they are recording porn
I was quoting Ross from Friends -> Sorry is that a well known one I watched the whole series and still have no idea what the reference is
Dude they changed the logo for a day Unless you were jacking it to the logo this doesn t affect you -> It s not about the logo I really don t care about transgender They can do what they want I m fine But if watch TV then I don t want to see this every fucking time Like feminism it s not about the movement anymore It s just a attentionseeking and pressuring other people
We re gonna be the generation that treats everyone the same and they ll start getting mad that s there s no special treatment or attention anymore and call it oppression In reality it s just successful integration being integrated in a society doesn t mean you get a special day week or month it means you get treated like everyone else lmao -> I can guarantee you that no minority will complain about not getting attention due to successful integration What a fucking ignorant thing to say
Feminism fought for women s rights which paved the way for identity politics Now everyone s decided that gender is a choice and women are suffering the most because of it -> How are women suffering because trans people exist Aside from sports that s ridiculous lol
Only Mr Meeseeks exists -> And his existence is pain
I am transitioning into nonexistence goodbye -> Ooh ill join you To infinity and beyond
Women are trans men -> Technically if ur a Christian or Jewish person than yes
You don t exist man -> No im a woman so I don t exist Only men exist according to the gamer code
c o mv cc us -> Lesbian porn made by men for men
Ok apparently I ve missed the Joke so what is it -> The joke is they want someone to send them lesbian porn
c o mv cc us -> SFW
I agree That s what I was saying -> That s what WE were saying Communism intensifies
That is the better part of the discussion but there were still an unreasonable amount of people claiming to be victimized by people watching a porn genre that could also describe them I mean theres porn of gay dudes turning straight dudes and I m not into that but I m not going to complain about being fetishized like they were That s some butthurt homophobia type bullshit if you ask me Even when it comes from lesbians Is it still homophobia if it s a gay person saying that straight people shouldnt enjoy gay things -> I mean yeah I d expect that people would be butthurt about gay sex
This You cant win with people that complain about this kind of thing Last week it was super offensive for straight people to beat off to lesbians It fetishizes them for straight people and that s wrong apparently I was reading a whole post where that was the debate and now if you dont fetishize them on this one day you re a bigot Jerk it to whatever you want and dont let a day of recognition dictate what type of horny you should be tf are you talking about -> I never saw anyone saying it was offensive to jerking it to lesbian porn lmao
Sorry is that a well known one I watched the whole series and still have no idea what the reference is -> Check out the episode The one with the birth I was paraphrasing that line by ross
It s not about the logo I really don t care about transgender They can do what they want I m fine But if watch TV then I don t want to see this every fucking time Like feminism it s not about the movement anymore It s just a attentionseeking and pressuring other people -> Not everyone who wants to be visible does it for the sake of attention There are real issues in the world that need to be acknowledged and confronted and we re not going to stop acknowledging and confronting them just because they make you uncomfortable
I can guarantee you that no minority will complain about not getting attention due to successful integration What a fucking ignorant thing to say -> If that where true people nowadays wouldn t get mad at individuals companies etc for not changing there logo for pride month Yet they do ironic You also wouldn t have days weeks or months of VISIBILITY if that group DIDNT want the attention on them You
Yeah man society is going downhill Fuck this BS Let s just go on a lonely island and survive there and without the rest of this world -> That s the plan and why you see articles about how Gen Z is ruining This is what happens when you have a whole generation millennials raised on the premise and constantly told that they re all special and everyone of them deserves special attention If everyone s special no one is
How are women suffering because trans people exist Aside from sports that s ridiculous lol -> You just proved me right I could list other areas but you re just going to keep excluding them because its common sense that there are differences between biological men and women
And his existence is pain -> Mr meeseeks is at the centre of everything that happens to him
Why did you need to go and rope me into this -> I don t know HE roped Me into this
men are actually trans women that s why we have nipples we are born women but then the male hormones kick in -> Actually the process takes place in utero you re born a male or female The embryo starts out as female then becomes male prior to birth
Technically if ur a Christian or Jewish person than yes -> Wouldn t it be like trans rib or something
No im a woman so I don t exist Only men exist according to the gamer code -> Lol Honestly my comment is a quote from The Office
Lesbian porn made by men for men -> Where the inclusively We need Gay porn make by woman for woman NOW
The joke is they want someone to send them lesbian porn -> That s disgusting Where do you find this lesbian porn I need to know so I can avoid it
SFW -> Not even a little
That s what WE were saying Communism intensifies -> PornCommune
I never saw anyone saying it was offensive to jerking it to lesbian porn lmao -> I have seen people equating porn consumption to fetishizing the average person of an orientation before I feel like it doesn t pop up a lot but randomly does happen Probably infrequent enough honestly not surprised that some people may never encounter it
Check out the episode The one with the birth I was paraphrasing that line by ross -> Oh the quote every day is lesbian lover day is too different form what you said and on a post nothing to do with friends no way in hell you can expect someone to know that s what you were doing Don t Me like I m an idiot for not getting your barely a reference to a line from a year old show that has nothing to do with current post lol
Not everyone who wants to be visible does it for the sake of attention There are real issues in the world that need to be acknowledged and confronted and we re not going to stop acknowledging and confronting them just because they make you uncomfortable -> Exactly there are real issues War envoirement Problems These problems are really laughable
They can do what they want I m fine But if watch TV then I don t want to see this every fucking time Classic case of I m not homophobic I just don t want to see LGBTQ ever -> No I really don t care Do whatever you wan to do I just don t want to be effected I just want to enjoy a movie and not get teached about how much greater woman are or how much greater trans people are It s just annoying af
That s the plan and why you see articles about how Gen Z is ruining This is what happens when you have a whole generation millennials raised on the premise and constantly told that they re all special and everyone of them deserves special attention If everyone s special no one is -> Yeah and everyone can define themselves as a man no one is We are currently undoing years of scientifical developement
You just proved me right I could list other areas but you re just going to keep excluding them because its common sense that there are differences between biological men and women -> You can t list one besides sports or you would lmao You said women were suffering not there s a difference between men and women hahahhah Nice try though but crazy disingenuous
I don t know HE roped Me into this -> He roped me into this
Actually the process takes place in utero you re born a male or female The embryo starts out as female then becomes male prior to birth -> Yes I phrased it wrong
Wouldn t it be like trans rib or something -> Yeah
Lol Honestly my comment is a quote from The Office -> Sorry I didn t get the reference I barely watched the office Parkour
Where the inclusively We need Gay porn make by woman for woman NOW -> Do you want the link
That s disgusting Where do you find this lesbian porn I need to know so I can avoid it -> Going to hazard a guess here Total shot in the dark mind you But I think maybe on PornHUB
Not even a little -> Too late I m fired
I have seen people equating porn consumption to fetishizing the average person of an orientation before I feel like it doesn t pop up a lot but randomly does happen Probably infrequent enough honestly not surprised that some people may never encounter it -> Yea but that s not really a popular belief
I dont really give a shit if you ve had different life experiences than me -> well where did people say that
Oh the quote every day is lesbian lover day is too different form what you said and on a post nothing to do with friends no way in hell you can expect someone to know that s what you were doing Don t Me like I m an idiot for not getting your barely a reference to a line from a year old show that has nothing to do with current post lol -> I did not make you look like an idiot I posted the comment for my satisfaction and if by chance someone got it then good I am sure you have google in whichever third world country u live in So please look up paraphrasing Also if u didn t like the comment don t respond you toxic POS FO
Exactly there are real issues War envoirement Problems These problems are really laughable -> Right I suppose the ongoing attack on human rights isn t a real issue Okay then
No I really don t care Do whatever you wan to do I just don t want to be effected I just want to enjoy a movie and not get teached about how much greater woman are or how much greater trans people are It s just annoying af -> I can t remember any mainstream movie with a trans character let alone with a trans character in any kind of meaningful role
Yeah and everyone can define themselves as a man no one is We are currently undoing years of scientifical developement -> When everyone s super no one will be
You can t list one besides sports or you would lmao You said women were suffering not there s a difference between men and women hahahhah Nice try though but crazy disingenuous -> How about in women s shelters or bathrooms These are all private areas reserved for women
Sorry I didn t get the reference I barely watched the office Parkour -> You ve got Have a solid day friend
Do you want the link -> r woosh
c o mv cc us -> at this point im counting how many times ive seen presumably the same link here
Yea but that s not really a popular belief -> Yeah just saying it definitely exists unfortunately since you said you d never seen it
I did not make you look like an idiot I posted the comment for my satisfaction and if by chance someone got it then good I am sure you have google in whichever third world country u live in So please look up paraphrasing Also if u didn t like the comment don t respond you toxic POS FO -> I didn t say you made me look like an idiot I said to not treat me like I am one for not getting your barely a reference You acted like it was obvious when you referenced a quote by using none of the words from the quote lol Also not sure why you re calling me toxic I ve been taking this as a humorous exchange not an angry one Chill out man it s the internet have fun
Right I suppose the ongoing attack on human rights isn t a real issue Okay then -> Yeah the human rights being shit on by Putin The problems you are facing are luxury ones
I can t remember any mainstream movie with a trans character let alone with a trans character in any kind of meaningful role -> I can t remember any time any LGBTQIA or girl character was met with any other concern than WOKE POLITICS BAD WRITING whatever and such also happens alot with PoCs as well just because whomever was portrayed wasn t a cishet dude or anything If these people don t go with the I don t care but angle usually they re up to saying the actual ordeal instead
How about in women s shelters or bathrooms These are all private areas reserved for women -> Bathrooms Really So disingenuous lmao I sincerely doubt many trans are taking over women s shelters either but perhaps you might have a point there Maybe But doubtful And even if true women aren t suffering because a trans person is in the room next to them Bathrooms is ridiculous though and you know it I ask you what legitimate tangible way are they suffering outside sports
r woosh -> I knew it was a joke but I will provide link even if someone is joking
Yeah just saying it definitely exists unfortunately since you said you d never seen it -> Well Yeah But I Meant Does It Exist Commonly Plenty Of Ideas Exist Anyways But Depends On The Relevance
Bathrooms Really So disingenuous lmao I sincerely doubt many trans are taking over women s shelters either but perhaps you might have a point there Maybe But doubtful And even if true women aren t suffering because a trans person is in the room next to them Bathrooms is ridiculous though and you know it I ask you what legitimate tangible way are they suffering outside sports -> It s almost like I said you would dismiss any evidence that proved you wrong Gonna have to let the local circus know one of the clowns got out
Well Yeah But I Meant Does It Exist Commonly Plenty Of Ideas Exist Anyways But Depends On The Relevance -> It exists enough to have some relevance Also what is with the sudden shift in the way you wrote your sentence Genuinely not making fun I m just very lost there
It s almost like I said you would dismiss any evidence that proved you wrong Gonna have to let the local circus know one of the clowns got out -> You provided one piece that may be an issue in a very exaggerated way and I gave credit to that You re other points were just nonsense that boils down to trans people scare me It s almost like I put in a failsafe so I could deflect when you critiqued my hate filled rants And then clowns to boot hahahaha So original bud you forgot a snowflake or two though
I don t have siblings but even I understand that it s a love hate relationship -> Also the way Arnold is drinking that beer is just funny
Am I just missing the funny haha or is this not a meme -> I made it ass lol
Why would a girl want this -> Sometimes you just really need a few tacos Even if they re from the bell
Get your parents to get a divorce then get you mum to hook up with a rich dude and make sure they have a date the same day you want to go to your girlfriends house its a win win win because you get alone time with your girlfriend your mum finds someone she loves and you now have the chance to inherit a large fortune -> Have the chance to inherit a large fortune my ass Your relationship with your mom will probably go downhill from then onwards because she will spend too much time with that dude Then she will disown you because she thinks that you are a bad child and that she better be off with that rich dude Years later that dude will abandon her after he finds a new woman and your mom will start to beg you to help her like she didn t disowned you years ago But hey at least you got to clap your girlfriend
There s a whole series called Mom s Teach Teens -> Oh like something similar to that YouTuber who s a dad and teaches people life skills
Okay listen closely shit yourself ask to be cleaned fuck your mother wait for father to return fuck him to burn down your family home whilst they are distracted from the cheatkng incest fire go to her house explain about the fire fuck her make some scrambles eggs eat everything in her house but the eggs turn every electrical appliance on full sit in the bath and cry jump out the top floor window return home help rebuild your life from scratch say the fire was an act of god and its because you had sex out of wedlock gather a bunch of preists perform an excorcism on her turn your head and start killing the preists get a job in mc donalds be a mong and smell everyone that even remotely comes nere you swim in the fryer oil dayly a bit of you in everyone talk to a cannibal on craigslist meet him her uno reverse card you eat them talk to your parents about boundaries access the th dimension summon katar desteoyer of worlds -> did all these im in this weird brick place with a bunch of bars keeping me im what do i do now
Oh like something similar to that YouTuber who s a dad and teaches people life skills -> Yeah kind of
What would you call this -> Anything but a meme
Smile with your eyes not with your mouth -> Exactly
The coal vs nuclear power debate is strong evidence of how media sensationalism ruins the public discourse Coal really only have one thing going for it and that is being cheap Otherwise it s killed more people both directly and indirectly it pollutes more harmful chemicals it is worse in terms of greenhouse gases and it makes you reliant on other countries resources unless you produce it yourself nearly all countries in the world could mine uranium it s just cheaper not to -> Not to mention run out of Uranium you get Thorium instead ofc it ll take a bit of rebuilding but in if done smart won t be an issue And yes ik Thorium isn t as god like as papa Sam O nella says but still
Except that Germany doesn t build new coal power plants We re now behind China India Japan and the US in terms of coal power It s more about mining than burning it The remaining coal industry just has their hands deep up our politicians asses jostling for space in there with the car indstustry -> Yeah Germany is replacing the nuclear with renewables which reddit has suddenly decided to hate
The governments thoughts summed up Uranium go boom Uranium bad Coal not go boom Coal good -> It s more like politicians go ok who is gonna pay me the most
Them shutting down nuclear plants to burn coal is something I just don t think I can ever understand -> They want to shut down coal too they already closed mines up so you can t get the coal anymore And they are planning to destroy the nuclear power plants so when a new government should come that they can t simply turn them back on
emissions per capita time latest fuels per capita tab map time latest -> No you can t just post data that refutes my simple take on a highly complex issue
Closing nuclear power plants is a bit silly But building new nuclear power stations is a bit more complex than people would make it seem with its own time and cost overruns These things can take years to build Rather burn some coal while you build up more profitable renewables -> Closing nuclear power plants is a bit silly These reactors were built in and I don t know how long they could have been operated but I m guessing they have been shut down at some point either way These things can take years to build Also factor in here the time it can take for german bureaucracy to do it s thing
Does anyone know the exact reason Germany did so I personally am skeptical of nuclear but it s definitely better than coal and non renewables -> Well a lot of the older generation pushed for the regulation of it and they knew nuclear as a cold war threat and cathastrophies in ukraine japan It was before the wide public saw co as the devil so they fought the thing that they saw as worst part of energy production back then and stand by that sentiment till today
Go nuclear Go green Glowing green -> Concentred natural glowing green metal go brr Edit yes I know uranium is pretty much gray
Can someone explain the reasoning here I was under the impression that Germany was a world leader in renewable energy sources to the point where they lost a lot of money on inefficient versions of the technology -> According to some people in the comment section the nuclear power is going to be replaced by renewables Also while some people will be quick to praise new safer nuclear reactors these power plants were simply not using those kinds of reactors
Meanwile in the german canteen heared from my co worker we do all the CO savings while other countrys dont care blow out coal like crazy Everyone is loughing at us since we are the only one so stupid to save CO -> India and China
Except China is the biggest carbon polluter with more than the next countries combined and they are building on average two new coal plants every week and plan on increasing that number Germany is on that list -> China may be the biggest polluter but that not entirely its own fault Many production are being outsourced to china so pollution that would normally happen in other countries now happens in china inflating the amount of carbon emissions from china
Why is everyone demonizing co -> Nobody hates Carbon Dioxide they just hate that there is so much that there is a byproduct If I gave you a cup of water you d be happy If I gave you bottles of water you d be happy if you stockpiled and didn t recieve more for a bit If I gave you The Ocean you would drown in your hatred for me You were given water that was inherently good but too much caused a negative byproduct Real life being Heat this scenario being lack of Oxygen
The worst part is that coal puts out far more radiation than nuclear power plants -> Got a source on that
Chernobyl and its consequences have soured an entire generation towards nuclear power when the culprit was actually the inefficiency of Soviet power plants It s a shame too Nuclear power is our best solution against global warming -> Not inefficiency but human failure
Shame on you OP for being such a bold faced liar Germany is still reducing emissions and most of the nuclear capacity was replaced by renewables -> Was it really Afaik we just started our coal factories because of lack of energy Our government is fucking us sideways and people are happy about it
FYI CO makes up off earth s atmosphere man made climate change is a meme -> Its a scam to make money thats all
That s a really good picture -> Thanks I get this idea year ago but at this time I wasn t good enough with photoshop Everyone can use it If you have memes idea don t hesitate to take it
every german when you talk about the climate crisis germany only makes of global greenhouse gas emissions china should start elf people who are genuinly interested in fighting climate crisis we could easily have renewables by now we don t need unsafe and expensive nuclear waste -> while nuclear isn t safe its not dangerous either nor is it very polluting
Germany tends to have a history of burning things -> r technicallythetruth
Efficiency Bu Nein efficiency -> What efficient Efficiency in what I see theyre still keeping up the tradition of gasi
Every country damn OP doesn t realize that every country is not located in North America or Europe cause the vast majority of other countries are very much not giving a fuck about climate change because they have developing nations with people who will die without coal by the millions and lose our on the only feasible means of growing their economy Also the amount of pollutants by country is FAR worse outside of the west simply by China and quickly growing to be India Most countries in the world do not have ANY care to go green Furthermore how are you going to trust the reports of these countries who regardless of their actual practices are incentivized by the west to be green despite it being bad for them -> Yeah I m sorry it was indeed very misleading to say eVeRY cOuNtRy When making the meme I just didn t gave much attention and it seems like I say that Germany make the most Co emissions but it was about Germany s politicians saying that they do their best for the environment despite highly increasing their coal usage So yeah saying eVeRY cOuNtRy for the paris agreement is so fucking dumb and ethnocentric and now everyone repeat thing that I already know in the comments because I failed my only task to do a proper caption
And the problem is -> Idk the warming climate that is going to destroy millions of lives at the very least if not completely annihilate humanity Also coal is just plainly stupid to use as of right now Especially with nuclear power literally RIGHT there
I think we should figure out how to harvest electricity from having butter sex And make it a requirement for all politicians to spend half their shift having butt sex and generating electricity -> Dude solved energy crisis
Guess you never seen how much fossil fuels China burns there air pollution is so bad in some areas that they put up a huge banner so people could see what the sun rise is supposed to look like -> Aigain I know how China s industry is the biggest Co emitter and by a lot but this meme was about the incoherence of Germany s politicians saying that they do their best for the environment while they actually increased a lot their coal usage But you re right by the fact that saying in the meme every country was clearly misleading and I am sorry
What s the matter with bi atomic cobalt -> Wouldn t it be di atomic
Yeah There is always China and India who will easily dwarf Germany -> America too but the lowered their output by a really big amount
Where did the rumor come from that Germany is increasing fossile fuel consumption to compensate for the archaic nuclear power plants shutting down They made up a negligible amount of Germany energy consumption anyways -> Negliable They were putting out around and more before shutdown increasingly lowering their output we are just buying the missing energy now from other countries like France which LITERALLY BUILT NEW NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS at the border to Germany so they can sell it to us
Fym every country lmao what -> I m sorry that was misleading It was about the paris agreement and how Germany s politicians say that they od their best for the environment but have increased their coal usage for electricity production Of course China makes the highest carbon emissions with their worldwide industry and saying eVeRY cOuNtRy was indeed dumb
China the Philippines and India -> I know that Germany is really not the worst Saying eVeRY cOuNtRy was stupid misleading and I am sorry I was talking about Germany s politics saying that they do their best for the environment while Highly increasing their coal consumption But with that shitty caption I made it seems like I just omit completely china s Co emissions and I m sorry
Not to mention run out of Uranium you get Thorium instead ofc it ll take a bit of rebuilding but in if done smart won t be an issue And yes ik Thorium isn t as god like as papa Sam O nella says but still -> i mean thorium is pretty cool the armour looks fire even for a pre hardmode ore armor and the weapons aren t half bad
Ye coal power plants emit more radionuclides than nuclear power plants Like how dafuq there are people who say NPPs are radioactive -> They think the steam comes in contact with the uranium That s assuming they know that it s steam from the towers and not smoke or something
correct me if i am wrong but the only gas that comes from nuclear power is steam from the water heating right -> Yep but even including contaminants from the extraction and refinement of the uranium itself and the spent fuel coal is dirtier
I ll go one step further if you are opposed to both fracking for natural gas nuclear power and to be clear you might have good reasons for doing so but if you do oppose then I believe you must accept one of two possibilities We cannot and should not expect to counteract the effects of Global Warming Or the world must revert from it s industrial first world model back to something resembling the agricultural age I do not see how you expect to meet the energy needs of the modern world with solar wind geothermal biomass and hydro electric power They are too inefficient inconsistent Solar doesn t work everywhere and is inefficient for the landmass it takes up Similarly hydro electric is region locked and doesn t work for landlocked states countries Geothermal is probably the most expensive to produce for the amount generated has hyper specific land requirements and isn t proven to burn as clean as natural gas Wind tech wears out easily and creates a lot of polluting plastics such as windmill rotos Biomass can lead to massive deforestation to meet our current energy requirements So for every one arguing coal bad nuclear bad fracking bad Ok fair enough but what do we do instead What s your ultimate goal here You can t just say thing bad let s stop it you have to evaluate the costs because something has got to give in this discussion -> Interesting thing about hydropower is the very few see it as a dangerous source of power Even though it is one of the most dangerous ones due to the risk of dam failure Everyone has heard about Chernobyl which killed a dozen or so directly and possibly at worst a few thousand indirectly But how many had heard about the Banqiao Dam failure of This killed between directly and about indirectly as well as destroying at least million homes
We literally just destroyed another town to get more lignite so we can produce more cars Which seems bad since air pollution kills a lot of people each year I m not sure if we have had a single nuclear reactor related death in Germany But at least now we can feel even more self righteous when we lecture the French about their nuclear reactors -> I was down voted elsewhere a few weeks ago for bringing up that Germany was even using lignite Worse than coal
nUt nUvLear wAasrte Like burrying shit kilometers underground in secure vault is in any way dangerous lol Also pretty sure our food causes more cancers than all the serious nuclear incidents ever a grand total of Honestly I fucking hate what the world has become everything is fucking dumb When I was growing up I expected people in charge to do the logical best thing I m now and what a rude fucking awakening its been Fuck -> Except it is dangerous and that s why it s so tough finding a spot Germany thought they were safe then it turns out water was getting into their waste storage and now the have to move it all If it were just that simple then it would have been solved by now Significantly smarter people than you have been working on it
I know that s not what you meant but by coal directly killing people I imagined a coal piece with a gun -> No you just breath it in
But is it cheap Building a coal power plant is cheaper than nuclear one but is it cheaper to run and fuel I would say no And uranium basically has no other use than for this -> I m going by the lifetime cost Though of course we know nuclear power plants can be run way beyond their planned lifetime as that is the case with many built in the s The uranium is as you say not the major expense
today cheapest energy source is solar only thing coal has going for it is that it s there and you don t need to Invest much you just keep it running -> Only if you do not factor the cost of compensating for irregularity and then wind is cheaper One of the greatest fallacies of wind and solar is to take for granted that someone else will produce power when wind and solar cannot But really what it means if that for every kW of solar you need a kW capacity of some other power source That or pay up for storage capacity Right now consumers absorb the cost by paying extortionate prices during low wind and solar availability And sure nuclear need maintenance but that maintenance is in nearly all cases predictable and even flexible
Yeah Germany is replacing the nuclear with renewables which reddit has suddenly decided to hate -> which reddit has suddenly decided to hate Reddit didn t suddenly start hating renewables it finally recognized the concept of base load and that without significant advances in battery technology renewables cannot service that need We are simply sick of the renewable sycophants who think real life is like a game of SimCity where you can just spam wind turbines down and everything is hunky dory When these people start talking shit about nuclear ignorantly we tend to clap back at them pretty hard and I suppose you could misconstrue that as suddenly deciding to hate renewables
fires up extra coal power capacity plug winter supplies -> None of that contradicts my comment We didn t build any new ones just kept using the ones we had Turns out you gotta get your power somewhere when your biggest supplier cuts you off
we are behind these countries with at least times our population and are famously terrible for emissions doesn t really mean a lot -> All those countries still build new coal power plants wich is my actual point Edit except for the US
It s more like politicians go ok who is gonna pay me the most -> I guess russian cheap gas was too good to say no In fact it was too good to say yes to nucelar yes I said nucelar
The dumb ass climate activists -> Real climate activists know that Nuclear is better for the environment
They want to shut down coal too they already closed mines up so you can t get the coal anymore And they are planning to destroy the nuclear power plants so when a new government should come that they can t simply turn them back on -> What a stupid decision Until they can rely on renewable energy or if we eventually crack contained nuclear fusion then nuclear fission is by far the safest and most effective energy source Destroying these nuclear plants would set their goals for fixing climate change back years
Don t worry I ll explain it since literally no one understands it apparently Our rivers are LITERALLY too hot most of the year to run nuclear power We LITERALLY cannot use nuclear power Which is why Austria France Spain Denmark and so many other countries REGULARLY import power from Germany France for example has of their nuclear power plants offline at all times because they can t run them And if we wanted to use them we would kill everything living in those rivers because if they get too warm they can t store oxygen anymore Which is why those plants will be replaced by renewable energy which on some days was already of our powersource -> Thank you this makes more sense than ecolobbies went wild
Because that didn t happen -> turns its back on nuclear for good despite europes energy crisis
No you can t just post data that refutes my simple take on a highly complex issue -> that s fair anyways this is the meme subreddit not animettities I forgot I was in reddit what a world to live in neither WorldPolitics mostly because you wouldn t be posting anime titties or plants
Closing nuclear power plants is a bit silly These reactors were built in and I don t know how long they could have been operated but I m guessing they have been shut down at some point either way These things can take years to build Also factor in here the time it can take for german bureaucracy to do it s thing -> I imagine they could extend the life of the plants by replacing the steam generators of each unit But that is also a factor Red tape and compliance issues can add to that
The public opinion on nuclear energy here is quite bad U know fukushima and Tschernobyl After the disaster of Tschernobyl most people realised how dangerous nuclear power plants can be I m skeptical of nuclear too but like u said better than coal etc Unfortunatly we ve got problems in terms of managing when it comes to renewables i hope that changes Edit I m skeptical towards nuclear power plants because of more than Fukushima and Tschernobyl I know that modern reactors are safer but there s always room for failures And i dont really want to be near a power plant if that happens -> Modern nuclear reactors are the cleanest and safest form of energy we have at the moment Both the Fukushima and Chernobyl meltdowns were due to poor design Not to mention that Fukushima only killed person the rest of the deaths were due to the massive tsunami Literally almost any form of energy is more deadly than nuclear and nuclear being dangerous is an illusion created by media
While they indeed increase their renewable energy source parts they also have closed all their nuclear power plant and replace them with coal power plant which is the fossil fuel that basically pollute the most So they have highly increased their Co emissions while their politicians are saying that they do the maximum for the environment Of course Germany s actions is not the biggest problem for the climate of course but Its problematic considering the fact that they say indeed that they do their best Love to German peoples fighting aigainst the destruction of that town to create a coal mine That was the subject of the meme -> They did not replace them with coal they simply closed them according to what was agreed on decades ago The majority of closed plants wouldn t have gotten the permission to continue running due to safety regulations anyway Ofc it s true that there s a problem with coal mining and coal plants but that isn t related
Of course But this meme was about the increase of coal usage in Germany Tho you can use this image to make a meme about china s high fossil fuel usage -> But coal usage is not increasing Thats because your meme is dumb Pls at least to check the fact you re building your memes on
Nobody hates Carbon Dioxide they just hate that there is so much that there is a byproduct If I gave you a cup of water you d be happy If I gave you bottles of water you d be happy if you stockpiled and didn t recieve more for a bit If I gave you The Ocean you would drown in your hatred for me You were given water that was inherently good but too much caused a negative byproduct Real life being Heat this scenario being lack of Oxygen -> Okay But the global warming isnt as bad as some people out there go about promoting Which is what I dont understand Climate change is just that Change The amount of heat and co being generated isnt bad Its actually showing more greening on the planet There have been studies on co and plant growth before And the added heat over the entire planet as a whole is more so what people should be focusing on when it comes to that topic They want to talk about the climate change Look at the overall increase over not just a couple decades because that doesnt matter You have to go back thousands of years to understand the planets climate There has been times when the entire planet has been snowball earth yes But millions of years ago Its also been tropical I am not pro pollution Clean up our act Lower harmful outputs Clean up the oceans Etc But co itself isnt bad and the heat it is creating isnt bad Want to talk about bad Lets talk about global cooling Everyone keeps thinking in such short spans of time and it changes how they think things should develop The technological development rush and race just became so crazy that people didnt always think about why we are developing these things or how long it takes and the fact that it comes down to having to rely on the best current systems we have and trying to do our best But everyone wants something new all the time now And it leads to so much waste in materials and time And its just fricken ahsjtbsk d orz Everyone wants a better world but how many actually understand what kind of effort that takes
Got a source on that -> The most credible sounding Source on the first page of Google wastes coal fired power plants text When coal is burned to combustion wastes are fly ash Essentially fly ash waste from coal power plants has amounts of uranium and thorium inside of it which due to the nature of being inside ash and therefore airborne spread a lot more radiation than contained controlled waste from a nuclear power plant
while nuclear isn t safe its not dangerous either nor is it very polluting -> so what are we going to do with the waste have it in your basement what if we have draughts like in france when they had to shut down of their nuclear reactors
Idk the warming climate that is going to destroy millions of lives at the very least if not completely annihilate humanity Also coal is just plainly stupid to use as of right now Especially with nuclear power literally RIGHT there -> Idk the warming climate that is going to destroy millions of lives at the very least if not completely annihilate humanity That s not a problem Also coal is just plainly stupid to use as of right now Especially with nuclear power literally RIGHT there Nah it s not
Aigain I know how China s industry is the biggest Co emitter and by a lot but this meme was about the incoherence of Germany s politicians saying that they do their best for the environment while they actually increased a lot their coal usage But you re right by the fact that saying in the meme every country was clearly misleading and I am sorry -> Didn t mean to get on your nerves and I don t know how much fossil fuels Germany is burning I don t follow there politics since my country has become the joke of the world On the other hand I last heard that Germany is farther along that anyone else in developing a working nuclear fusion reactor in my opinion is amazing it is probably the only answer to getting away from fossil fuels since wind and solar are not capable of handling the current power demands let alone future power demands Not counting the pollution that they put out in manufacturing and how short the life span is
Wouldn t it be di atomic -> Maybe English is not my native language
i mean thorium is pretty cool the armour looks fire even for a pre hardmode ore armor and the weapons aren t half bad -> r unexpectedterraria
I just need is thorium generator and cryofluid to make lots of power -> Make sure to get lots of Anti air nearby or those stupid flares will go and ruin everything
Still it can produce a ton of power and is much safer than uranium -> Correct
But i thought Sam da man was law What am I gonna do now -> He is the law he just slightly exaggerated on Thorium either way he s right
They think the steam comes in contact with the uranium That s assuming they know that it s steam from the towers and not smoke or something -> The steam nuclear power causes is so clean you could drink it
Yeah it s water that goes through the condensing pipes that condenses the steam that spins the turbine That steam that comes out of the stacks is actually two isolated systems removed from the water that actually contacts the uranium Uranium heats up water that goes in a pipe and heats up the turbine water to true steam then back to the reactor the true steam goes and spins a turbine and is cooled by a condensing pipe the water for the condensing pipe comes from outside the plant and turns to steam out of the stack -> Fake steam taking all the credit
Interesting thing about hydropower is the very few see it as a dangerous source of power Even though it is one of the most dangerous ones due to the risk of dam failure Everyone has heard about Chernobyl which killed a dozen or so directly and possibly at worst a few thousand indirectly But how many had heard about the Banqiao Dam failure of This killed between directly and about indirectly as well as destroying at least million homes -> Another side note are places that do run off hydro also fuck up a lot of ecosystems and the more hydros you run in an area the less those hydros produce
Nuclear fusion for the win -> years away for the last years
Yea Im sorry Even mentioning fracking and nuclear in the same sentence indicates that you either drank the kool aid or are actively trying to spread misinformation -> This isn t an argument It s a thinly veiled insult and not a well founded one Every energy source has an environmental impact Every source has pros and cons It is valuable to constantly evaluate and reevaluate the pros and the cons to determine the best energy sources for our needs For example is wind power worth the trouble when it produces relatively little for the cost to upkeep the turbines In regards to fracking the collection of Natural gas has a high environmental impact however you cannot ignore that it s one of the most efficient and productive energy sources on the planet It s entirely possible that even though the initial impact of fracking is higher that it s energy efficiency outperforms other sources over the long term I m not actually claiming that I m simply saying it s worth consideration
I was down voted elsewhere a few weeks ago for bringing up that Germany was even using lignite Worse than coal -> Hey to reduce pollution you gotta increase pollution s
Except it is dangerous and that s why it s so tough finding a spot Germany thought they were safe then it turns out water was getting into their waste storage and now the have to move it all If it were just that simple then it would have been solved by now Significantly smarter people than you have been working on it -> Nevada literally refuses to allow it to be buried in a giant rock
I m going by the lifetime cost Though of course we know nuclear power plants can be run way beyond their planned lifetime as that is the case with many built in the s The uranium is as you say not the major expense -> We will be fucked when coal runs eventually out we need it for far more thing than uranium or other radioactive elements Ofc everything what was mentioned here the immense pollution from coal power plants or even mining coal itself And if we don t have enough reasons to stop making energy from coal it s also a fact the soil is much less rich on minerals without coal
which reddit has suddenly decided to hate Reddit didn t suddenly start hating renewables it finally recognized the concept of base load and that without significant advances in battery technology renewables cannot service that need We are simply sick of the renewable sycophants who think real life is like a game of SimCity where you can just spam wind turbines down and everything is hunky dory When these people start talking shit about nuclear ignorantly we tend to clap back at them pretty hard and I suppose you could misconstrue that as suddenly deciding to hate renewables -> Fighting over nuclear vs renewable is like arguing where to eat while papa coal is trying to drive you off a bridge
Lmao good luck with that Nobody is hating on renewable but its not efficient at all and sacrificing nuclear for them is just fucking dumb -> Why would you say something based solely on an opinion when there is scientific consensus that contradicts it something to read
None of that contradicts my comment We didn t build any new ones just kept using the ones we had Turns out you gotta get your power somewhere when your biggest supplier cuts you off -> You also have to get power elsewhere when you shut most of your nuclear reactors because of an earthquake on the other side of the world
All those countries still build new coal power plants wich is my actual point Edit except for the US -> As far as I can research America hasn t built a new coal plant since
Real climate activists know that Nuclear is better for the environment -> The environmental movement of the s s doomed nuclear in the U S through ignorant fear mongering We are where we are due to environmental activists
What a stupid decision Until they can rely on renewable energy or if we eventually crack contained nuclear fusion then nuclear fission is by far the safest and most effective energy source Destroying these nuclear plants would set their goals for fixing climate change back years -> Germany only received of its electricity from nuclear power plants These will not be covered by coal but from wind energy In the past they had to shut down the wind turbines because of to much power in the system The reactors were not able to shut down So as from now this will be handled by wind Only in absolut peaks it will be covered by coal There are so much misinformations around omg We have not switch nuclear power with coal And the Party who is crying the louadest had years to mad better politics but NOPE
So what s the plan Buy cheap gas from russians who are committing genocide -> Until our mentally compromised president took office we were exporting more natural gas than Russia We could easily supply the world with comparatively clean natural gas to provide power until a suitable replacement could be found A replacement like nuclear
Thank you this makes more sense than ecolobbies went wild -> It s pretty annoying to see the reaction from people everywhere we had demonstrations in Germany against it and voices from all over the world that just aren t informed sadly I am VERY for this solution until we build better nuclear power plants that have less waste and warm the water less Here s links if anyone is interested for proof btw warm water to reduce nuclear power output as french river temperatures rise maintenance problems in france half of french nuclear fleet is shut for works squeezing supply
They didn t shut down nuclear plants and burn coal to compensate -> No Coal power production is down since the nuclear exit started Nuclear was replaced by renewables Any increase in coal power production was either short term immediately after a shutdown or due do general increase of energy demand in Germany
Isar was the most modern safe and efficient nuclear powerplant in the world -> So you re telling me they didn t build any new ones at all after
Modern nuclear reactors are the cleanest and safest form of energy we have at the moment Both the Fukushima and Chernobyl meltdowns were due to poor design Not to mention that Fukushima only killed person the rest of the deaths were due to the massive tsunami Literally almost any form of energy is more deadly than nuclear and nuclear being dangerous is an illusion created by media -> If you can magically summone one of these that would be great but otherwise building them is going to take a lot of time and building them in germany is going to take even longer
After the disaster of Tschernobyl most people realised how dangerous nuclear power plants can be I m skeptical of nuclear too Basing your entire opinion of an energy source on disasters that happened with designs that were created in the s and have nearly a century of revision is pretty short sighted not gonna lie -> But many people actually feel the consequences even today For instance collecting mushrooms in forest is something where you have to consider radiation
But coal usage is not increasing Thats because your meme is dumb Pls at least to check the fact you re building your memes on -> It has increased Please check your sources before you make up stuff Gone up from to while nuclear has gone down from to Comparison is from to Sectors Enterprises Energy Production Tables gross electricity production html
Okay But the global warming isnt as bad as some people out there go about promoting Which is what I dont understand Climate change is just that Change The amount of heat and co being generated isnt bad Its actually showing more greening on the planet There have been studies on co and plant growth before And the added heat over the entire planet as a whole is more so what people should be focusing on when it comes to that topic They want to talk about the climate change Look at the overall increase over not just a couple decades because that doesnt matter You have to go back thousands of years to understand the planets climate There has been times when the entire planet has been snowball earth yes But millions of years ago Its also been tropical I am not pro pollution Clean up our act Lower harmful outputs Clean up the oceans Etc But co itself isnt bad and the heat it is creating isnt bad Want to talk about bad Lets talk about global cooling Everyone keeps thinking in such short spans of time and it changes how they think things should develop The technological development rush and race just became so crazy that people didnt always think about why we are developing these things or how long it takes and the fact that it comes down to having to rely on the best current systems we have and trying to do our best But everyone wants something new all the time now And it leads to so much waste in materials and time And its just fricken ahsjtbsk d orz Everyone wants a better world but how many actually understand what kind of effort that takes -> Theres an easy question to dismantle co haters ask them how much co is in the athmosphere as not absolute number and then ask them at what co plant life starts to fucking DIE The look on their faces is priceless
The most credible sounding Source on the first page of Google wastes coal fired power plants text When coal is burned to combustion wastes are fly ash Essentially fly ash waste from coal power plants has amounts of uranium and thorium inside of it which due to the nature of being inside ash and therefore airborne spread a lot more radiation than contained controlled waste from a nuclear power plant -> I m aware of the residues in flying ash it s just the more aspect baffling me considering the wastes during mining and storage of fission material
so what are we going to do with the waste have it in your basement what if we have draughts like in france when they had to shut down of their nuclear reactors -> Where do we store spent Solar panels
Idk the warming climate that is going to destroy millions of lives at the very least if not completely annihilate humanity That s not a problem Also coal is just plainly stupid to use as of right now Especially with nuclear power literally RIGHT there Nah it s not -> Ah yes the displacement and death of other humans is not a problem Silly me And care to explain how using coal isn t dumb
Maybe English is not my native language -> The way I know it is that di means like CO Carbon Dioxide
r unexpectedterraria -> I didn t realise it was a Terraria joke because I don t play modded Terraria
Make sure to get lots of Anti air nearby or those stupid flares will go and ruin everything -> Just get anti explode logic
Safer than uranium You know coal power is responsible of millions of deaths annually Wind power kills more people than nuclear power -> I was talking about Thorium
The steam nuclear power causes is so clean you could drink it -> Yeah that steam is two isolated systems away from the uranium Surprisingly the engineers are smart enough not to evaporate water that came in direct contact with uranium
Fake steam taking all the credit -> Goddam fake steam aka water vapor True steam is colorless and way fucking hotter than what we call steam the white water vapor
Another side note are places that do run off hydro also fuck up a lot of ecosystems and the more hydros you run in an area the less those hydros produce -> Turning the planet into an energy generating machine that s fkng metal
years away for the last years -> ITER is still on track last I checked I don t think even covid threw off their schedule too much Once that s online actual fusion power generation plants shouldn t be too far off They re still going to be far more expensive and unreliable than nuclear for a long time though
This isn t an argument It s a thinly veiled insult and not a well founded one Every energy source has an environmental impact Every source has pros and cons It is valuable to constantly evaluate and reevaluate the pros and the cons to determine the best energy sources for our needs For example is wind power worth the trouble when it produces relatively little for the cost to upkeep the turbines In regards to fracking the collection of Natural gas has a high environmental impact however you cannot ignore that it s one of the most efficient and productive energy sources on the planet It s entirely possible that even though the initial impact of fracking is higher that it s energy efficiency outperforms other sources over the long term I m not actually claiming that I m simply saying it s worth consideration -> It s not supposed to be an argument The argument is made by our scientists and you clearly have some reading up to do if you believe that we need to poison our wells in order to stop climate change Again either that or you are paid by people who do not give a f about our environment and just want to make a quick buck Stop spreading misinformation
Nevada literally refuses to allow it to be buried in a giant rock -> You mean the big rock right above a major fault line The rock made up of highly porous volcanic tuff that will eventually cause rainwater to leak in and corrode the containment I m sure that will be safe for the next k years Significantly smarter people than you have thought of this stuff my dude
Baseload is an outdated concept for fossil and nuclear plants that have hard limits on how flexible their generation can be A renewable grid doesn t really need to care about planning for periods of low demand With enough generation decentralization and firming a percent renewable grid is possible Meanwhile nuclear percent needs a peaker plant which is usually gas powered And backup coal plants for when maintenance is needed like France last summer -> Man even in the worst France produced Time less CO kWh then germany at their best And what you say is just absurd windturbine and solar panel are the worst in consistency and need a back up of gaz or coal whish is what the german choose Its litteraly impossible to have renewable energy in most contry the only one able to are with hydro who can stock but need specific land Last but not less important windturbine are still better then solar panel in most case and even then they need time the power needed to be in most case able to produce what is needed But you know when we need it the most yes on Winter and what happen in Winter YES big wind or no wind really not much time to produce with windturbine Nuclear and renewable should work hand to hand but with a solution to stock the renewable energy if not we can t trust it The best if we could stock is still in nuc and renew
You also have to get power elsewhere when you shut most of your nuclear reactors because of an earthquake on the other side of the world -> Sad but true
As far as I can research America hasn t built a new coal plant since -> Correct in fact coal power production has contracted by much for coals rebound plant closures come roaring back smart policy must unlock a just transition amp since and is projected to contract another by php id text The last large greater than fired capacity in the future Sure it s not enough but it s a FAR cry from saying that the US is still building coal plants demonstrably false Edit shitty links
Germany only received of its electricity from nuclear power plants These will not be covered by coal but from wind energy In the past they had to shut down the wind turbines because of to much power in the system The reactors were not able to shut down So as from now this will be handled by wind Only in absolut peaks it will be covered by coal There are so much misinformations around omg We have not switch nuclear power with coal And the Party who is crying the louadest had years to mad better politics but NOPE -> I didn t know that it would be replaced by wind energy it s good to know thanks I still disagree with shutting down nuclear plants rather than turning away from coal I don t care which party is taking these actions I m not from Germany so long as they re turning away from safer sources like wind solar nuclear and towards coal petrol etc I ll keep criticising
Maybe the plan should have been not relying on a single country for almost all the gas your country needs And clising nuclear power plants and coal plants will only make things worse and worse for germans But hey the governemt also wanted everyone to only drive electric cars wich who would have thought turned out to be a retarded idea aswell -> But what powers the electric cars you ask Just use the electricity from the outlet some German politician probably
No Coal power production is down since the nuclear exit started Nuclear was replaced by renewables Any increase in coal power production was either short term immediately after a shutdown or due do general increase of energy demand in Germany -> I wonder what could take some of the role that coal power plants play
So you re telling me they didn t build any new ones at all after -> Dont know about the other nations but in gemrany we didnt Even if it isnt the most modern which could very well be it was the most efficient and safe in germany As it never had any problems and was reliably doing its job for years non stop
If you can magically summone one of these that would be great but otherwise building them is going to take a lot of time and building them in germany is going to take even longer -> It is very much worth it as it is much cheaper than what you d expect and as I ve already said nuclear reactirs produce a lot of relatively cheap energy
But what s about the damage that radiation does to your DNA Thats often the point where its hard to count deaths and how it really affects people But yes newer ones are far more safe Btw mutations are permanent and will be given to future generations too -> Okay so I believe you have a very very simple idea of how mutations and dna works judging from the points you made don t get me wrong I m not a biologist either but genetics is one of my top interests So let me explain DNA is a code made from a combination of proteins and every living cell in your body cotains DNA It has the instruction required for a cell to perform mitosis and their tasks Mutations occur in the human body completely naturally each day trillions of mutations happen in your body due to small errors during mitosis There are some muations that aren t even harmful as they are one of the many reasons as to why evolution the way it is And if a mutation is harmful eg Cancer cells in most cases the cell literally deletes itself and if something goes wrong most times the immune system deals with them This also happens on a daily basis in the human body Of course the possibility is there that it gets out of contol and tumors form but most of the time it doesn t happen So no not all mutations are permanent As for radiation it only increases the number of mutations and errors in mitosis therefore increasing the chances of a tumor This is pretty unnoticable in modern nuclear powerplants though as they contain radiation really well so much so that people living next to a powerplant or people working in them barely recieve anything more than normal background radiation and isn t noticable So no contrary to popular belief living close to a reactor does not increase one s chances to get cancer or permanent dna damage If I made any mistakes feel free to point them out
It has increased Please check your sources before you make up stuff Gone up from to while nuclear has gone down from to Comparison is from to Sectors Enterprises Energy Production Tables gross electricity production html -> Pls look in your own source If you just take this two numbers you are right but if you look closer you find no causality between nuklear energy and coal In both droped to a low point then in both rised to a higher percentage and in yes only coal rised but not because of the ending nuklear energy but because of the embargos to russia that made Gas which should replace nuklear much less available so another energy was needed and you can t just abruply let a nuklear reactor going longer because you dont have the Personal Uran security checks needed for this and you whould need time that you dont gave to reinstall all this So it wasn t a option sadly
Theres an easy question to dismantle co haters ask them how much co is in the athmosphere as not absolute number and then ask them at what co plant life starts to fucking DIE The look on their faces is priceless -> Especially when you tell them that everything is measured in parts per million Like It takes over what tons of air to get like tons of carbon from the air or something And that by trying to make every single industry electric and reduce co admissions that we are not saving the planet but actively working towards killing it again
Where do we store spent Solar panels -> in new solar panels it is called recycling
just eat it s yeah that is a problem and nuclear isn t a permanent solution but i think establishing them is better than oil coal plants since renewable can t really do large scale energy production except hydro but that s obviously limited to water areas -> we could be on renewables right now simply putting solar panels on the roof of every house would be almost enough for most housholds then go with wind and hydro to produce excess power et voil
Usually when I ask this question the nuclear nuts just end up blocking me -> Most people I encounter say Let s shoot it to the sun that s when I block them
Ah yes the displacement and death of other humans is not a problem Silly me And care to explain how using coal isn t dumb -> Fuel is fuel Simple as that
I didn t realise it was a Terraria joke because I don t play modded Terraria -> Get yourself some TModloader and go wild
Just get anti explode logic -> Server has logic disabled c
ITER is still on track last I checked I don t think even covid threw off their schedule too much Once that s online actual fusion power generation plants shouldn t be too far off They re still going to be far more expensive and unreliable than nuclear for a long time though -> ITER is still on track last I checked ITER has just barely become energy positive and only for minutes There is still groundbreaking materials research that needs to be done in order to create the containment shields necessary right now they degrade far too quickly for commercial viability and we don t have anything that can fix that yet However research continues into that and many other areas But yes there is reason to be hopeful it could happen within our lifetimes
It s not supposed to be an argument The argument is made by our scientists and you clearly have some reading up to do if you believe that we need to poison our wells in order to stop climate change Again either that or you are paid by people who do not give a f about our environment and just want to make a quick buck Stop spreading misinformation -> By immediately jumping to claims of you believe we need poison our wells and you re paid by people who don t give a fuck about our environment you assumed that I didn t have ethical well thought out and scientifically backed claims to support my argument In other words you set up an easy straw man argument that you could morally high road rather than engage in an actual conversation This doesn t make you smart or right it makes you an ignorant zealot You simply replaced a holy book with whatever you think the scientific position literature represents
You mean the big rock right above a major fault line The rock made up of highly porous volcanic tuff that will eventually cause rainwater to leak in and corrode the containment I m sure that will be safe for the next k years Significantly smarter people than you have thought of this stuff my dude -> Significantly dumber people have stopped the government from doing what the smart people say to do Your second statement is meaningless until you cite the smart thoughts
Man even in the worst France produced Time less CO kWh then germany at their best And what you say is just absurd windturbine and solar panel are the worst in consistency and need a back up of gaz or coal whish is what the german choose Its litteraly impossible to have renewable energy in most contry the only one able to are with hydro who can stock but need specific land Last but not less important windturbine are still better then solar panel in most case and even then they need time the power needed to be in most case able to produce what is needed But you know when we need it the most yes on Winter and what happen in Winter YES big wind or no wind really not much time to produce with windturbine Nuclear and renewable should work hand to hand but with a solution to stock the renewable energy if not we can t trust it The best if we could stock is still in nuc and renew -> But you know when we need it the most yes on Winter and what happen in Winter YES big wind or no wind really not much time to produce with windturbine I barely took you seriously to begin with and now I know you don t know what you are talking about Wind turbines are generally set up at altitudes and in places where wind is constant Surface level wind you experience is irrelevant and most are continuous sources of energy In fact the only time they shutdown is when there is too much wind as a safety precaution I m betting you also think solar panels don t work when it s cloudy as well And they may have less CO but they also have a big waste problem they have no found a permanent solution to percent renewable is completely feasible and Germany has actually had a decline in coal and gas plants replacing them with renewables The idea renewables need nuclear or coal is a lie created by the unscrupulous people who run both industries
Sorry I got that wrong -> No worries
Why not replace of coal with wind instead It s still indirectly keeping coal around longer I m fine with phasing out nuclear but do it after phasing out coal not before Edit Germany still has about of it s grid from coal crisis pushes german energy use lowest level reunification -> Because nuclear reactors have been getting dismantled for almost years now in Germany The process was started years ago already and couldn t really be stopped
Also purchasing surplus nuclear from France -> Germany exported TWh and imported TWh in Only THh were imported nuclear power from France Meanwhile TWh were exported to France Because oft the hot summer and defect nuclear power plants in france
But what powers the electric cars you ask Just use the electricity from the outlet some German politician probably -> An electric car is essentially just a bunch of additional batteries that support the grid by balancing out volatile energy sources We want more batteries not less
I wonder what could take some of the role that coal power plants play -> Renewable energies The major problem is The CDU has decided to phase out nuclear power but forgot to expand renewable energies
Dont know about the other nations but in gemrany we didnt Even if it isnt the most modern which could very well be it was the most efficient and safe in germany As it never had any problems and was reliably doing its job for years non stop -> I m just guessing that reactors propably aren t allowed to run forever Even if the risk of a reactor failing on any given day is low in the beginning it will propably get higher the longer it is in use Even with maintainance and switching out old parts for newer ones at some point you propably have shut it down for safety reasons
It is very much worth it as it is much cheaper than what you d expect and as I ve already said nuclear reactirs produce a lot of relatively cheap energy -> I m not talking about money I m talking about time You cannot spend time like you spend money the time it takes to build such a reactor wont decrease So unless you can immediately summon one it would take a long time to build one
Okay so I believe you have a very very simple idea of how mutations and dna works judging from the points you made don t get me wrong I m not a biologist either but genetics is one of my top interests So let me explain DNA is a code made from a combination of proteins and every living cell in your body cotains DNA It has the instruction required for a cell to perform mitosis and their tasks Mutations occur in the human body completely naturally each day trillions of mutations happen in your body due to small errors during mitosis There are some muations that aren t even harmful as they are one of the many reasons as to why evolution the way it is And if a mutation is harmful eg Cancer cells in most cases the cell literally deletes itself and if something goes wrong most times the immune system deals with them This also happens on a daily basis in the human body Of course the possibility is there that it gets out of contol and tumors form but most of the time it doesn t happen So no not all mutations are permanent As for radiation it only increases the number of mutations and errors in mitosis therefore increasing the chances of a tumor This is pretty unnoticable in modern nuclear powerplants though as they contain radiation really well so much so that people living next to a powerplant or people working in them barely recieve anything more than normal background radiation and isn t noticable So no contrary to popular belief living close to a reactor does not increase one s chances to get cancer or permanent dna damage If I made any mistakes feel free to point them out -> Ah okay well im also not a biologist too but i already knew about what you wrote But thats ok most people dont really know and now somebody pointed it out I just wanted to keep it short and kinda simple Well the background radiation might not be a problem but what about failures Like lets say something breaks and radiation breaks out Idk if i m too biased for this maybe i am and thats why im still skeptical Btw Username checks out haha
in new solar panels it is called recycling -> Where do we keep broken windmill blades Give me a recycle for that
we could be on renewables right now simply putting solar panels on the roof of every house would be almost enough for most housholds then go with wind and hydro to produce excess power et voil -> Lmao no
Fuel is fuel Simple as that -> That s got to be the worst argument I ve heard in a while You re saying that using coal as fuel is fine even though there is a better cleaner and safer energy at your fingertips You ve got to be trolling
ITER is still on track last I checked ITER has just barely become energy positive and only for minutes There is still groundbreaking materials research that needs to be done in order to create the containment shields necessary right now they degrade far too quickly for commercial viability and we don t have anything that can fix that yet However research continues into that and many other areas But yes there is reason to be hopeful it could happen within our lifetimes -> ITER has just barely become energy positive and only for minutes You re thinking of a different reactor ITER is still being built and is still several years away from being functional I think you re thinking of EAST which is tiny compared to ITER ITER is still definitely a research reactor but it is projected to be easily energy positive Once it s online it s the perfect test bed for that materials research It s being built with a full remote handling system to easily remove and study all wearing components That ll make it dead simple to swap in prototype parts too Actual production fusion plants being possible is still a ways off but probably not as far as most people think The question is whether they will be financially viable in our lifetime ITER is a billion project While a lot of that may be R D the facility is still a massive chunk of that cost and any production plant is going to be roughly the same size or larger Nuclear is going dirt cheap in comparison for the forseeable future
Because nuclear reactors have been getting dismantled for almost years now in Germany The process was started years ago already and couldn t really be stopped -> But they did stop the process for almost a year after Russia shut off gas They could have kept them but chose not to
An electric car is essentially just a bunch of additional batteries that support the grid by balancing out volatile energy sources We want more batteries not less -> That s a good point if technology to take advantage of it is used I m thinking about smart charging that monitors electricity production and prioritizes charging during hours where there s excess power being produced Now that you made me think about it there are actually a lot of optimizations to be done with energy production
I m just guessing that reactors propably aren t allowed to run forever Even if the risk of a reactor failing on any given day is low in the beginning it will propably get higher the longer it is in use Even with maintainance and switching out old parts for newer ones at some point you propably have shut it down for safety reasons -> No you actually dont The only reason these reactors were shut down is because some Idiots decided they dont want nuclear energy because wind and solar energy is so much better lmao to that
Ah okay well im also not a biologist too but i already knew about what you wrote But thats ok most people dont really know and now somebody pointed it out I just wanted to keep it short and kinda simple Well the background radiation might not be a problem but what about failures Like lets say something breaks and radiation breaks out Idk if i m too biased for this maybe i am and thats why im still skeptical Btw Username checks out haha -> Modern reactors have failasafe designs chernobyl was a very primitive one compared to the ones we have today The USSR cheaped out on safety measures and that s why it melted down Furthermore it wouldn t have been such a catastrophe if the government wasn t lying to citizens about the severity of the problem Modern won t melt down like that
Where do we keep broken windmill blades Give me a recycle for that -> like any trash we need to find ways to reduce reuse and recycle
Lmao no -> well yes
That s got to be the worst argument I ve heard in a while You re saying that using coal as fuel is fine even though there is a better cleaner and safer energy at your fingertips You ve got to be trolling -> I m not
But they did stop the process for almost a year after Russia shut off gas They could have kept them but chose not to -> Almost a year More like months They were originally scheduled to shut down on Dec but were postponed until April And they couldn t keep them because no T V no workers and no fuel elements
No you actually dont The only reason these reactors were shut down is because some Idiots decided they dont want nuclear energy because wind and solar energy is so much better lmao to that -> Just because that s why they were shut down now doesn t mean that you could have ran them forever otherwise
like any trash we need to find ways to reduce reuse and recycle -> Pls when u find a way to reuse glassfibre let us know
I m not -> Okay
You can t do that with Nuclear Reactors Once the shutdown process starts it is very expensive and also unfeasible to really prolong it -> But they did At least for a couple of months
Pls when u find a way to reuse glassfibre let us know -> why me i am a simple electrician lol
But they did At least for a couple of months -> Nah It was talked to do so but is dangerous nuclear plants needs manteinance if they will be used but if you have already years to dismantle them I wouldn t be surprised that Prypiat plants be in better state Too late to stop that sadly
I forgot what I was gonna comment -> Thank you
Then the nose would start to grow because it wasn t growing -> But when it grows the statement becomes true so his nose won t grow
His nose doesn t grow if he s wrong about predicting the future which is what is being implied here My nose grows is a statement that can be true or false My nose will now grow is a prediction of events yet to occur It is not a lie nor is it the truth -> It is inevitable
bro just discovered self referential paradox carry on bro you ll soon stumble upon the halting problem and the class of unsolvable problems -> In particular this is a proof that a Turing machine that accepts if and only if a given statement is a lie cannot exist as it would lead to a logical contradiction
He becomes a human vibrator -> I dont think thats what he meant when he said he wanted to be a real boy
His other nose grows -> You mean the lower horn
But when it grows the statement becomes true so his nose won t grow -> It s a repeating cycle of growing and shrinking Kind of like how it is in life
How about My nose is going to grow in the next seconds -> Still a prediction of the future
I dont think thats what he meant when he said he wanted to be a real boy -> Well I guess he is now I mean his wood is pretty hard
It s a repeating cycle of growing and shrinking Kind of like how it is in life -> Like some kind of thrust mechanism power drill sex toy
It wasn t true at the moment he said it -> But it becomes true after
Like some kind of thrust mechanism power drill sex toy -> Precisely

Google for Explosive Reactive Armour meme or something like that -> Google for en passant

How did they invade Liechtenstein by accident times -> I mean yeah I saw it in a qxir vid As far as I can see there s no rule against links so here

New research rocket just dropped -> On norway

Yes Finished high school DOS or earlier That s what makes me feel old -> I remember when a inch floppy wasn t due to my Viagra prescription running out
What do you mean old That was like yesterday -> At my college we still have few PC with Windows XP running why bcs some student installed them and staff doesn t care and we love it
I m Windows for Workgroups old -> I m Windows for first PC old
so like old enough to drink but in all seriousness there are people who outright refused to upgrade when vista came out there are still people who use xp -> Am in I T people won t upgrade for various reasons Some have programs that work and have no replacement or a migration path to move the data Some refuse to pay to upgrade when what they originally bought still works A few corporations refuse to upgrade because it would take the entire boardroom to agree and approve budget and that just isn t happening
I turned on my first computer years ago content uploads CoCoDiskExtendedColorBASIC png w -> Woaahh that s cool man
Older my first computer was a TRS -> The Trash You are old and had money

It s like the fifth time i see this same meme and that it dies in new -> At this point they are hitting a corpse
Don t customers already basically pay for miles by the delivery fee that costs more less depending on how far the delivery is -> Was about to say they already add like bucks on to every order any more then that I wouldn t use it and just drive myself to the restaurant
Honestly I don t suggest anyone take up dashing Had a roommate that did it for spare cash for an entire year and while it paid for his gas money after putting about k miles on his car in a single year he eventually broke down and then without a car he lost both the money from dashing and his regular much better paying job He had to sign a ridiculous amount for a used car that barely ran to get back on the road Now the car he has broke down again but he can t turn the car in without still owing everything he hasn t paid yet and hes worse off than he was before he took up dashing -> Yeah I ve sworn off any gig app or real job or that matter that require me to use my own car It s a losing game when you factor in wear and tear and I believe anyone who claims they re making decent money from them are not paying attention to that If you need some money in your pocket right now there are worse options but it is not a replacement for a real job
I stopped using DoorDash awhile ago The fees seemed to just skyrocket -> I never used it but I heard all the horror stories I m glad those were shared so I never used it
That s an excellent way to convince people to just go out and get it themselves -> I posted this on r DoorDash and they are trying to roast me
Fastest way to lose customers as well lol -> Oh well
Man I tried to sign up for door dash and it said they re full on drivers But I get a fuckin email every day saying that I should sign up and start earning -> Same grub hub too
Why not make the people who pay you just pay you better Better yet find a better job You re barking at the wrong tree here -> I mean I could if I didn t have to live on a crutch so my hip won t go out I have to do the best I can Looked for different jobs and all got denied because of it This is the only job I was accepted in
Make the customers pay not the company lol -> You let me know how to do that
Lol Yes the down votes I know I just called out all the no tippers -> A bunch of people who expect the service to be free Not a single one would use door dash if they couldn t skip the tip and had to pay a premium on the delivery to pay a good wage Posers
If you can t read it tap on the picture -> why are they downvoting you clearly once you tap on the picture the words aren t blurry anymore
Was about to say they already add like bucks on to every order any more then that I wouldn t use it and just drive myself to the restaurant -> More than that Especially with the heightened menu prices alone
No they can take the tips or don t give them tips -> are you saying doordash takes costumers tips and doesn t give them to the drivers Or are you saying costumers don t tip when the delivery fee is more expensive
Kinda opposite story My buddy bought a cheap used moped for and a nice rear hanging basket on Amazon and started door dashing Things been paid for years now and he dashes all the time for extra cash keeping the miles off his main car I d suggest going that route for anyone looking to get into dashing -> Probably smart mopeds are pretty cheap Limited range but you won t have as much to worry about in terms of gas and I don t remember if they need Insurance but probably not much
I need it for food for my family -> To be honest bad work ethics should not be encouraged
I never used it but I heard all the horror stories I m glad those were shared so I never used it -> It started out really nice but now You order dollars of food and where it was in delivery it can easily double the price between their fee and a tip
I ll still use Uber Eats on occasion but DD is utterly ridiculous I ve put my order into both apps before same exact store same exact order and DD was more and it s not like there wasn t already a mark up extra fees on the Uber Eats one I m mad about it tbh I used to use DD for busy days at the law firm all the time back in Loved the service Now they re just crooks -> Uber eats isn t as bad but it s also higher than I remember
I posted this on r DoorDash and they are trying to roast me -> You should be roasted
Oh well -> Yeah who cares about having people that pay for the food and service right
I mean I could if I didn t have to live on a crutch so my hip won t go out I have to do the best I can Looked for different jobs and all got denied because of it This is the only job I was accepted in -> My brother you re living on a crutch and decided being a delivery guy is the only suitable job for you in the world
You let me know how to do that -> I m not advocating for this customers to pay I was pointing out that it s funny that a lot of these people think so lol
Especially college kids Sorry I absolutely HATE dashing to the college near me Order after order there s no tip I ll do one or two and then quit dashing after that a trip isn t worth my time -> Well it s so the executives and ceo make money The drivers get screwed
are you saying doordash takes costumers tips and doesn t give them to the drivers Or are you saying costumers don t tip when the delivery fee is more expensive -> A lot of times customers won t tip The app will give us perorder and the rest of the tips will come from the customer If they choose to tip us The customer can also tip the money and pull it out after the dasher accepts the order This has happened to me times even though I make my deliveries on time
Not trying to be mean or anything but wouldn t it be better to just get a different job Unskilled labor like this was never really meant to pay a sustainable wage -> Thank you for this reply I have something call Hip dysplasia to wear my leg can pop out of my hip I can t go on disability because the state doesn t allow it I had been applying jobs after jobs for the last years this is the only job that I got accepted into Which it works for me because I have a child that goes to school half of the day
It started out really nice but now You order dollars of food and where it was in delivery it can easily double the price between their fee and a tip -> I stopped using it once I found out that they also inflate the menu prices as well Was going to get Lenny s but the prices looked off so compared them with the actual Lenny s app menu and they add like more per sandwich on top of their fees
You should be roasted -> Good I get off from roast
Yeah who cares about having people that pay for the food and service right -> Right May as well suck their cock and feed them
A lot of times customers won t tip The app will give us perorder and the rest of the tips will come from the customer If they choose to tip us The customer can also tip the money and pull it out after the dasher accepts the order This has happened to me times even though I make my deliveries on time -> Just because America had raised you to tip it shouldn t be mandatory and no I m not giving you a tip for doing your job
Thank you for this reply I have something call Hip dysplasia to wear my leg can pop out of my hip I can t go on disability because the state doesn t allow it I had been applying jobs after jobs for the last years this is the only job that I got accepted into Which it works for me because I have a child that goes to school half of the day -> You should edit your earlier post to reflect that Might alleviate some of the downvotes Also have you considered a phone job Call centers kinda suck but it s more stable work than relying on tips
I stopped using it once I found out that they also inflate the menu prices as well Was going to get Lenny s but the prices looked off so compared them with the actual Lenny s app menu and they add like more per sandwich on top of their fees -> I did not know that So they add wayyyy more than it should be
Right May as well suck their cock and feed them -> Lol what No one is forcing you to have that job What an odd and crass take
Just because America had raised you to tip it shouldn t be mandatory and no I m not giving you a tip for doing your job -> If you ask for a tip before the service is completed It s not a tip it s a service charge Remove the tips and make it service charges
You should edit your earlier post to reflect that Might alleviate some of the downvotes Also have you considered a phone job Call centers kinda suck but it s more stable work than relying on tips -> Honestly if people can t see that maybe this person may be in a situation where they don t have a choice I shouldn t have to explain myself if someone is going to come up and start being rude in the beginning For the downvote votes doesn t matter to me because i don t have no desire for achievement
Yup It s like dominoes you order they refuse the order until you get it above or something So you re like fine add something else to make it Your order will be Eh Delivery fee Okay fine whatever Do you want to tip the driver Fuck no he s doing his bloody job and this is costing me basically more than I wanted anyway with all the additional fees in the first place The driver is getting paid the same wage I would be working at a checkout staff and you don t see them getting tipped for their work -> I used to be a delivery driver for Dominos and we can tell when you don t tip I ve spit in so many pizzas because a mother fucker can t give me for a order
Then don t engage in businesses where it s customary to tip the employees especially when you know the employees make less than minimum wage and depend on those tips That makes you an ass hole -> It makes me an asshole to not want to pay people s wages Because I m not there god damn employer
Honestly if people can t see that maybe this person may be in a situation where they don t have a choice I shouldn t have to explain myself if someone is going to come up and start being rude in the beginning For the downvote votes doesn t matter to me because i don t have no desire for achievement -> just a suggestion take it or leave it I have a friend with hip dysplasia and she works as a security guard manning a bunch of security cameras There are jobs Not many but they exist I just can t help but think you re selling yourself short
If you don t want to tip go pick the pizza up -> Why They have delivery drivers I wouldn t tip the guy making my pizza not that they give you that option why would I tip the driver The driver hasn t given me exceptional service they ve turned up with my pizza which they get paid to do
I used to be a delivery driver for Dominos and we can tell when you don t tip I ve spit in so many pizzas because a mother fucker can t give me for a order -> Isn t that a crime that can get you jail time I m glad I m not in America wouldn t want to stress out about paying someone s wage because the company they work for doesn t do it What a fucked country
It makes me an asshole to not want to pay people s wages Because I m not there god damn employer -> When you buy food at the grocery store you re effectively paying for the employees wages If you underpaid that d make you an ass hole You stiffing people YOU KNOW it s customary to tip and is part of their wages makes you an ass hole If you feel so strongly about it you should try to get the laws changed Until then don t waste a server s time with your old man screaming at clouds attitude
just a suggestion take it or leave it I have a friend with hip dysplasia and she works as a security guard manning a bunch of security cameras There are jobs Not many but they exist I just can t help but think you re selling yourself short -> I am glad your friend is able to get that as a job with their condition I have it to where I need a crutch for the lest of my life
Why They have delivery drivers I wouldn t tip the guy making my pizza not that they give you that option why would I tip the driver The driver hasn t given me exceptional service they ve turned up with my pizza which they get paid to do -> The driver uses the vehicle they pay for gasoline to get that vehicle to you costs money So does insurance on said vehicle it s a service that you re expected to pay for
Isn t that a crime that can get you jail time I m glad I m not in America wouldn t want to stress out about paying someone s wage because the company they work for doesn t do it What a fucked country -> If they can prove it but plenty of servers do it too Think about that the next time you wanna take away someone s only means of paying their bills when you go eat a restaurant
Then you re a piece of shit full stop nobody made you work that job you choose it based on the wages the company offered you Obviously you got away with it but I hope someone does the same to you one day and you end up with a lifelong illness for it it would be the only fair form of justice for such abhorrent behavior -> Probably not I m smart enough to get vaccinated But you decided to order pizza and not tip instead of going to the grocery store so who s fault is it really
I am glad your friend is able to get that as a job with their condition I have it to where I need a crutch for the lest of my life -> do you climb out of your ride and use a crutch to drop food off
The driver uses the vehicle they pay for gasoline to get that vehicle to you costs money So does insurance on said vehicle it s a service that you re expected to pay for -> I m expected to pay for my pizza and the delivery fee I m not expected to tip that s extra money I can choose to pay for above average performance the same as I would in a restaurant
If they can prove it but plenty of servers do it too Think about that the next time you wanna take away someone s only means of paying their bills when you go eat a restaurant -> I won t because in the UK tips don t pay people s wages So no spit for me
Probably not I m smart enough to get vaccinated But you decided to order pizza and not tip instead of going to the grocery store so who s fault is it really -> Yours for being a shitbird nobody deserves to have their food messed with especially by some shitwad who is angry at himself for accepting a shit job and takes it out on innocent people
Do you mean big booby latina porn or is it a boot fetish -> Smartest Reddit user
Ironic He could save others from being banned but not himself -> Is it possible to learn this power
As a furry most of us agree that nfts are fucking stupid -> Good to know
Good to know -> furries agree furry porn nfts are bad
Sounds like something straight out of Animal Farm -> Everyone s equal but some are more equal than others
Stop you re making them conscious of their rights as civilians -> Information enters the brain and confuses it
Public schools are designed to produce factory workers Stop telling them they have rights -> Fuck this is accurate and I wish it wasn t
We hold these truths to be potentially true that all men are created that they are endowed by my Creator with certain allowances that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness wages -> that life part it iffy it s pretty hard to have a life when you spend your entire existence working so you can pay your landlord who owns other rental houses pay off all the student loans that you needed to take out and keep your car running so you can get to the job that pays you something barely enough to afford the gas it takes to get there
Since when do redditors care about individual rights Especially the ones in the constitution -> Considering how many of them vehemently oppose the second one Since never On the flip side you have the other dumber half blatantly ignoring a key part of the first one regarding laws and religion
I mean it s basically purely dependent on how she did it What rights how is she portraying it etc She could have been a great teacher or a ideologically unhinged person who has no business around kids This headline tells us nothing Edit here is the whole article grade teacher in austin texas gets reprimanded for teaching students about their legal and constitutional rights im concerned that they find that concerning Even after you read it you still don t really know if she was right It doesn t say what she was teaching about rights It does suggest she is extremely liberal and political So if she taught anything more than these are the bill of rights etc she was rightfully reprimanded -> If you look at what she posted on tik tok there s another section where they ask the same questions about Harry Potter The way the questions are asked it s not saying she can t teach them about rights it s saying how does this fit in with your expected lesson plan Based on her absolutely smarmy tik tok presence I suspect she s deviating from what is expected to be taught and the principal is asking her to justify why it s being taught within the lesson plan This is completely reasonable of course but she ll frame it whatever way she wants because she s it s apparent based on her posts she s attempting to be a tiktok influencer
The only rights you need to know about are the states rights the second amendment not the well regulated part and the first amendment regarding hate speech the GOP -> I m sure it s just a matter of time before MAGA hat wearing brown shirts are suddenly part of the school system there You re free to teach what we tell you to teach
Texas is falling into FASCISM just like florida -> Kind of person to say everything they don t like is fascist
The GOP everybody -> Tbh e teacher was reprimanded for teaching about rights the left doesn t like it was Austin a far left extremist city
I mean were they teaching this instead of the rd grade curriculum It s important to know your rights but it s also important to know how to read and do math If the teacher was using their classroom as their own soapbox to air their grievances then I can see reprimanding them -> She s teaching them about the government part of the curriculum and their right to not stand for the pledge of allegiance It s not some random political grievance she s brought up for no reason
Conservatives We love the Constitution Teacher Hey kids let me tell you about what the Constitution says Conservatives BURN THE WITCH Hey conservatives y all are fucking pathetic -> Think it has to do with her rights as a queer person they had issues with There s something about a dresscode violation Seems like there is more to this than the title is suggesting
Well it s Austin so it would make sense that some liberal school district would get mad about that -> Projection
When I was in high school one of our teachers told us that as soon as we were on school grounds we didn t have any constitutional rights -> I know you probably know this already but for anyone who doesn t in Tinker v Des Moines the Supreme Court ruled to that students and teachers do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate
I can t wait to see how the right wing rationalizes this -> Probably that she shouldn t have been teaching abortion or queer rights to year olds Or that she went off curriculum Or that she s using this to continue her political advocacy online Doesn t make you suspicious that she isn t telling us what exactly she was teaching them Or that her social media is heavy into queer rights abortion politics and anti free markets It s like reading a bad meme at this point
This is facism America you are experiencing facism and you don t even realize it There isnt a big flashy banner that lights up when youre in a facist country The changes happen slowly over time Just like Italy with Musollini and just like Germany with Hitler -> shhh let them figure it out on their own so they can keep some form of American exceptionalism
Republicans in a nut shell -> Austin is run by Democrats
its funny as fuck cuz rd graders and anyone under the age of dont actually have constitutional rights -> Apparently you missed quite a bit in school The Supreme Court ruled in that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate This is true for other fundamental rights as well Here is some reading for you your rights students rights s Rights
Schools have a lot of legal authority over their students because of legal policies that give them the similar rights as parents when they re under school supervision That authority is given along with the responsibility for taking care of the kids Obviously schools get sued every year for overstepping -> Someone posted a link us news us people are that brainwashed texas teacher under fire for teaching students constitutiallegiance and harry potter ar AA Zfj below with the headline People are that brainwashed Texas Teacher Under Fire for Teaching Students Constitutional Rights The Pledge of Allegiance and Harry Potter God I remember being a kid and cramming so hard to pass Harry Potter class So unfair she was told off for spending class time on vital knowledge about Harry Potter it s like one of the only classes from rd grade that I still make use of as an adult s
Folks I hate to spoil your fun but there s no such thing as rights They re imaginary We made em up Like the boogie man Like Three Little Pigs Pinocio Mother Goose shit like that Rights are an idea They re just imaginary They re a cute idea Cute But that s all Cute and fictional George Carlin -> Wholeheartedly agreed I love that man
Of which you clearly failed differentiating your and you re GG -> You ve
Fr -> You all have rights and so don t I
filibuster -> It seems you have a tenuous grasp on the English language in general
Fuck this is accurate and I wish it wasn t -> How is this accurate
Factory jobs make up less than fucking percent of the workforce in the United States Touch grass -> Remind me again the year when our current model was set up Also why do we take summers off Why not winter off when it s difficult for lots of areas to travel in snow
those are completely different people its conservatives saying the first thing and libs saying the second -> bro what Liberalism in the United States is a political and moral philosophy based on concepts of unalienable rights of the individual The fundamental liberal ideals of freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of religion the separation of church and state the right to due process and equality under the law are widely accepted as a common foundation of liberalism sound familiar it s the constitution like straight up
that life part it iffy it s pretty hard to have a life when you spend your entire existence working so you can pay your landlord who owns other rental houses pay off all the student loans that you needed to take out and keep your car running so you can get to the job that pays you something barely enough to afford the gas it takes to get there -> You have a right to life as in your parents don t have the right to get an abortion Aka pay taxes till you die and we wont care when you die
A kid doesn t have the ability to fully understand abortion sexuality or gender -> Isn t development of students understanding part of the school s mission
Apparently you don t understand that Austin has become a progressive hipster hellhole If a teacher was reprimanded then it was because they didn t toe the left wing line -> Do you live here Have you gone to school here It s normal I ve had an ancap friend who pretty much went to school every day in a suit Another girl had a copy of the constitution in her pocket at all times and we used to have fun debates in both english and social studies classes It s not a leftist indoctrination center unless being you believe learning about evolution in th grade bio is cultural marxism If you bothered to read the article grade teacher austin texas html the teacher is progressive and absolutely not on your side Judging from the administrator s letter she was teaching them about freedom of speech protest and the ability to remain seated presumably during something like the morning pledge To be fair this is probably overblown the admins are probably making sure the teacher isn t attaching her own personal beliefs to the lessons and making sure that each student individually has their own reasons to practice such speech But it does go to show how skeptical the Austin education establishment is about freedom of speech and breaking from the conservative norm Judging from the comments apparently a bunch of other progressive Texas teachers quit due to similar treatment
Should be frowned upon anywhere Teach the law and let the kids form their own opinions of each political issue of their time -> I agree when it comes to current political and social issues schools should do their best to remain unbiased
I don t know Austin is very liberal The rights this story is referring to could literally be anything -> They could be but the teacher is very very outspoken on social media So I am assuming I will admit
Considering how many of them vehemently oppose the second one Since never On the flip side you have the other dumber half blatantly ignoring a key part of the first one regarding laws and religion -> Considering how many of them vehemently oppose the second one Calling for common sense gun laws that don t even violate the second amendment is not vehemently opposing the second amendment But enjoy your mental safe space that the NRA has set up for you where librulls are evil freedom stealers and guns are a natural resource
I was selected to be on a jury for a case that was definitely a you probably did it but the law here is unjust and you had a rational reason to do it and others in your circumstances would have done the same situation It finished we were taken to the deliberation room and given the spiel I mentioned jury nullification almost immediately as the door closed only to be met with confused faces The foreman popped his head back in before I could explain and said Oh we forgot that one of you was an alternative in case someone didn t show up both days He pointed to me and said I was free to go Never thought I would be upset to not have to carry out jury duty But I was fuming the entire way home -> What a coincidence
Every response after this main post is pure delusion and self aggrandisement -> Weird to talk about your own response that way but ok
I m sure it s just a matter of time before MAGA hat wearing brown shirts are suddenly part of the school system there You re free to teach what we tell you to teach -> They ve been teaching liberal bullshit for years It s about time conservatives do the same thing
There is a reason why most civil rights auditors and lawyers are right wing and currently hate Biden Just saying -> What the fuck is a civil rights auditor Do you mean a civil rights attorney
Tbh e teacher was reprimanded for teaching about rights the left doesn t like it was Austin a far left extremist city -> LMAO a far left extremist city They made Beto O Rourke they re about as centrist as they come If you think Austin is extreme far left I really think reading some history and expanding your political education could benefit you Could you tell me what makes them an extreme far left city Because they might vote for Democrats but if you think those guys are far left your conception of politics is flawed and makes you look like you ve been misled Don t want to be a sheep do you
Think it has to do with her rights as a queer person they had issues with There s something about a dresscode violation Seems like there is more to this than the title is suggesting -> So it s Title IX discrimination which is laid out in the Constitution and reinforced by SCotUS decision Again y all are fucking pathetic
Austin is run by Democrats -> Texas is Republican tho
It s probably worst now All these shootings has made any public setting full of paranoia -> I m currently suspended for days for threatening a teacher Now I m waiting for a mental evaluation or whatever so I can go back to school Update I had to give a police statement and that s it I just did the evaluation the school wanted me to get and turns out I m not mentally ill So uh screw the haters i guess
SIKE this would be very concerning you are correct now if they said Psych -> I ve heard it both ways
You ve -> You dn t
Seriously tho what the fuck is happening in the US It seems that since like months or something you only hear shit like absolutely garbage anti democratic stuff from the US -> fascists are masks off for the election
Yeah I m sure that s what it was Shocking you would make it the most extreme possible example Thank you for bringing your incredible bias into the conversation -> I think it was just an example of what could have been said It could be anything without more information A lot of people are seriously misinformed on what rights they have and what they actually mean Look at SovCits
How is this accurate -> What is the purpose of school in the US Now tell me how they fulfill that purpose or how they don t fulfill that purpose Once you go down this train of thought the conclusion is just sad
jesus christ how are we so fucking ignorant about labor capital relations in this country -> Propaganda is powerful
Remind me again the year when our current model was set up Also why do we take summers off Why not winter off when it s difficult for lots of areas to travel in snow -> Pretty sure summers off were included so that children could continue to serve as farm labor I know the history but don t understand your point You arguing we should end the charade and put the kids too poor for private school straight to work
That s way higher than I thought I guess they really are churning out factory workers then -> Doubling down on stupid and wrong Good look
look into the history of the public education system in the us -> What Say what you mean Make a point offer some sort of opinion Any idiot could say oh I don t have a reply I m just going to make some vague comment about looking something up
Bud the school board in question is comprised entirely of registered Republicans -> In Austin I haven t looked into this and I don t really care the point I was trying to make is that you can t take arguments given by different people and put them together Its annoying when conservatives do it too as Im sure youll agree
Isn t development of students understanding part of the school s mission -> The parents also need to teach their children as well not just the school
Do you live here Have you gone to school here It s normal I ve had an ancap friend who pretty much went to school every day in a suit Another girl had a copy of the constitution in her pocket at all times and we used to have fun debates in both english and social studies classes It s not a leftist indoctrination center unless being you believe learning about evolution in th grade bio is cultural marxism If you bothered to read the article grade teacher austin texas html the teacher is progressive and absolutely not on your side Judging from the administrator s letter she was teaching them about freedom of speech protest and the ability to remain seated presumably during something like the morning pledge To be fair this is probably overblown the admins are probably making sure the teacher isn t attaching her own personal beliefs to the lessons and making sure that each student individually has their own reasons to practice such speech But it does go to show how skeptical the Austin education establishment is about freedom of speech and breaking from the conservative norm Judging from the comments apparently a bunch of other progressive Texas teachers quit due to similar treatment -> Well said Not to mention the idiotic become progressive as if it happened in this century Or even last century Hint Austin s been progressive pretty much since it was first settled Only years between its founding and voting in against joining the confederacy May be earlier examples than that that s just the big one that comes to mind I strongly suspect AISD was aiming to prevent retaliation by the state here while minimizing impact to productive instruction
I agree when it comes to current political and social issues schools should do their best to remain unbiased -> Oh goody an unbiased debate about whether I get to live truly the heteros grace and mercy knows no bounds
Considering how many of them vehemently oppose the second one Calling for common sense gun laws that don t even violate the second amendment is not vehemently opposing the second amendment But enjoy your mental safe space that the NRA has set up for you where librulls are evil freedom stealers and guns are a natural resource -> Why are retired police always exempt from these common sense gun laws
You must be the most misunderstood and hated person on Reddit All this nonsense from the people responding to one half of your statement I m not sure if you re the row of centrist that I can get along with But I think I can because I absolutely agree that Am has a part that says Make no law And Am has the part that says shall not be infringed -> About the only conservative opinion I have is on guns and even then I m all for figuring out actual common sense ways to keep guns out of the hands of people who clearly shouldn t have them I think we should reform immigration to actually make it EASIER to become a citizen that test is stupid while also agreeing that we need to strengthen the southern border from crime My lines are weird but I generally subscribe to I don t give what you do so long as it doesn t negatively effect other people
The politicians throwing the dumber constituency under the bus for their own fascist gain right now We can be like dur hur yeah let them I don t like republicans but that s kinda how fascism works -> Okay but fascists don t have to actually take away anyone s guns to be fascist Apparently a lot of people seem confused on that point like Nothing can be fascist if they let me keep my guns No you re just not important enough for your guns to matter to fascists
The same people saying trans people are bad the same people that said police violence is terrible and responded to people shouting for the police to be defunded by giving the police more money and equipment The same people that made you fight for gay rights but just kinda handed over weed The government that serves buisnesses over the American people The Republicans and democrats that cause a split in the American population dispite being the same organization The same government that protects the police that kill innocent people for talking back That is who they are -> I mean who specifically as in name names You responded with some vague hand wavy fluff that could be tabloid headlines without any thought behind it It s important to have original thoughts y know
Those soldiers have families those pilots have families those tankers have families just saying -> that doesn t mean anything Countries with military dictatorships abuse and torture their citizens regularly and nobody in their military gives a shit even if they have families
You re familiar with Afghanistan right -> The civilian forces in Afghanistan have access to similar weaponry as their military If our intention was ever to wipe out Afghanistan it would be glass already Instead we were trying to give support to the government at the time and look for one guy
What the fuck is a civil rights auditor Do you mean a civil rights attorney -> Both auditors check government officials in real time wipe on the field while lawyers do it on the court room
LMAO a far left extremist city They made Beto O Rourke they re about as centrist as they come If you think Austin is extreme far left I really think reading some history and expanding your political education could benefit you Could you tell me what makes them an extreme far left city Because they might vote for Democrats but if you think those guys are far left your conception of politics is flawed and makes you look like you ve been misled Don t want to be a sheep do you -> The fact that you think Beto is centrist more about you than you d think
So it s Title IX discrimination which is laid out in the Constitution and reinforced by SCotUS decision Again y all are fucking pathetic -> Not sure how Title IX applies to speaking about your sexual preferences to year olds Nor violations in dress code
Texas is Republican tho -> I am aware but that doesn t mean every little bit of it is Austin is a blue city
You would be surprised by how many people do not know their rights they probably did not know Cannot teach you what they do not know -> Wait you re telling me this whole time that going to public school didn t stop my rights That s kinda fucked so many times I could a used them
I taught mine EVERYTHING lol Maybe even too much but whatever they ask I explain to the best of my ability Honesty truth and the power of education -> I absolutely can not wait to tell my son s teacher to only teach him the controversial stuff
Too busy working to keep a roof drink and food for the whole family Just remember feminism fought for the right not to do their end of the deal in a marriage and then threaten the husband with it if she doesn t get what she wants Which means no parents to teach you Only the state -> You forgot the s right Right
I m currently suspended for days for threatening a teacher Now I m waiting for a mental evaluation or whatever so I can go back to school Update I had to give a police statement and that s it I just did the evaluation the school wanted me to get and turns out I m not mentally ill So uh screw the haters i guess -> deleted
They can search your stuff and your person at any time As an adult so can a cop Try telling them they can t you ll get an actual charge for resisting you can t just bully or harass other students You can t do that as an adult either Free speech protects you from government retaliation not consequences Harass someone in a provable way and you ll be looking at a civil suit Most schools require you to have vaccinated as well That s less a right and more like a requirement to enter As an adult a job can also require you to be vaccinated That s not infringing on a right if they don t hire you I m not arguing one way or another on this point I m just say that these might be bad examples of infringement on rights -> Cops need reasonable suspicion Students can be searched just because they re on school property Students also don t own their lockers which can also be searched for no reason Not sure what point you re trying to make but a student crying about their rights would be nonsense
Did you just use I imagine and Bigots in the same sentence -> Imagine Bigots is my favorite band
The board apparently had some legitimate concerns according to the article I read Teaching rights wasn t one of them -> Yes a moral and definitely unbiased Texas school board We should definitely believe that they have concerns about her
I found the article but I m going to make it up anyway -> I m not grade teacher austin texas html
theyre in third grade they arent even years old like texas is fucked up and down but its not right to put the burden of fixing that on children their rights are uncertain and in flux and at risk of being taken away telling year old kids that they should just do X no matter what anyone says because right now its their right even if it is and stays you all know that doesnt guarantee safety by any wild stretch of the imagination is dangerous to those children who arent mature enough to decide when and how to rebel -> They aren t having a burden put on them they are being taught to recognize what their government is allowed to do to them so when they are older they can recognize when something their government is doing is wrong
Source Somehow I imagine that it s likely that she merely pointed out that the Nazis forced their students to pledge loyalty to the government as a contrast to the fact that in the US children have a choice Out of curiosity do you disagree with an individuals right to not be forced to say the pledge of allegiance on demand -> Saw it on local news to my understanding she compared the two and insinuated they re the same then told kids they don t have to participate I m against forced patriotism everyone has the right to not participate
We do have the right not to stand I stopped in nd grade when I realized they had us pledge allegiance to a Republic before they even taught us what a Republic was Back then I knew something was fishy about that Today I recognize it as nationalist indoctrination -> A republic is a system where the the people are in charge of the gov less government in our lives its why there is a voting system in a real republic we THE PEOPLE should be voting for more than a president we should be the ones voting on what the politicians are voting for on our behalf for us behind closed doors we all should know of every bill that s being passed Unfortunately that s not what s going on now
What is the purpose of school in the US Now tell me how they fulfill that purpose or how they don t fulfill that purpose Once you go down this train of thought the conclusion is just sad -> Isn t that a problem specific to how the US screwed up public schooling though Public schools in general aren t to produce factory workers
Buncha edgy pessimistic redditors can t understand why schools teach kids so therefore it must just be to become a slave -> I DIDNT LEARN FUCKING ANYTHING IN SCHOOL AND NOW I HAVE TO WORK SO THAT MEANS SCHOOL ONLY TAUGHT ME TO WORK ffs these comments are definitely on one side of the bell curve
What the fuck are you talking about You said school is created to make factory workers What does that have to do with your reply Did you send this to the wrong comment -> I m posing some questions that if you search for an answer will lead to understand my viewpoint
What Say what you mean Make a point offer some sort of opinion Any idiot could say oh I don t have a reply I m just going to make some vague comment about looking something up -> Well if you looked it up you d learn for yourself Kids today want everything spoon fed to them
You should feel necessary to emphasize that in political theory US liberals and conservatives are both considered capitalist neo liberals and liberals are only at the least center right on the political spectrum Why This is because liberals and conservatives both vote Liberals vote Democrat Party and conservatives vote Republican If liberals were truly socialist they would revolt rather than vote because you cannot vote your oppressors out of power using your oppressor s own system of government This equates to being center right wing because while a Democrat politician may preach socialist policy in the country outside of the country they are dropping bombs on poor brown people just like their Republican counterparts Liberalism is not leftism You re all being played -> Based thStreetAngel
You forgot the right to own a gun and defend your self family and property -> You forgot the right to own a gun and defend your self family and property Are you saying he forgot liberals are for that or that it s in the constitution
semantic argument I hate you people -> you have a valid argument insert opinion thanks but i don t remember asking for your opinion though
In Austin I haven t looked into this and I don t really care the point I was trying to make is that you can t take arguments given by different people and put them together Its annoying when conservatives do it too as Im sure youll agree -> I haven t looked into this Oh dont worry its noticeable
Oh goody an unbiased debate about whether I get to live truly the heteros grace and mercy knows no bounds -> Since you are posting this clearly you re alive Mellow dramatic much
Calling for common sense gun laws that don t even violate the second amendment is not vehemently opposing the second amendment That s the motte in the very clear motte and bailey routine going on But enjoy your mental safe space that the NRA has set up for you where librulls are evil freedom stealers and guns are a natural resource Gee why would anyone doubt your sincerity in only wanting minor gun law reform Total mystery -> Calling for common sense gun laws that don t even violate the second amendment is not vehemently opposing the second amendment That s the motte in the very clear motte and bailey routine going on Kind of like protecting freedom and doing nothing about our absurd level of gun violence are seemingly the same thing for NRA propaganda enthusiasts I ve been intrenched in this same debate for over a decade now personally For some it s much longer Gee why would anyone doubt your sincerity in only wanting minor gun law reform Total mystery Because the NRA wants it that way Simple They have you convinced that when I say common sense gun laws I actually want to restrict the rights of innocent people just because some criminals are criminals and oh by the way criminals don t follow laws anyway so what s the point Right
See there you go assuming things because I m pro second amendment I m all for common sense laws IF they re actually common sense Magazine and firearm bans are not common sense Red flag laws are easily abused and far from common sense A firearm s registry which is easily abused when they decide to go beyond common sense is not common sense Requiring background checks for ALL firearm purchases Common sense Requiring a clean mental health check to purchase and own firearms Common sense Requiring training to own and operate a firearm Common sense The last one is extremely hard to do without a registry -> See there you go assuming things because I m pro second amendment People don t discriminate against conservatives just because they re conservative by the way It s because of bullshit like this Your opening line was an assumption Are you the only one allowed to exaggerate to make a point It s honestly so frustrating to talk to you guys about anything let alone the stuff you ve been taught to be passionate about It s pointless to continue this discussion
NRA is weak and fucking sucks and they do nothing to help firearm owners Cope -> NRA is weak and fucking sucks and they do nothing to help firearm owners Cope About what I agree with you that they don t do anything to help firearm owners After Columbine they became professional mass shooter apologists They also launder a lot of Russian money that is meant only to divide and destabilize us I wouldn t call them weak though they are pretty good at what they set out to do Here secret tape made after columbine shows the nras evolution on school shootings is an NPR article about when they chose their current mission
Okay but fascists don t have to actually take away anyone s guns to be fascist Apparently a lot of people seem confused on that point like Nothing can be fascist if they let me keep my guns No you re just not important enough for your guns to matter to fascists -> Actual fascists and nazis expanded gun ownership for populations they tried to make superior and restricted it for populations they were trying to put underneath In the US the tyranny of Jim Crow in the South and the city bosses in the North all rested on the backs of citizens with guns who gleefully sided with the tyrants time and time again
I mean who specifically as in name names You responded with some vague hand wavy fluff that could be tabloid headlines without any thought behind it It s important to have original thoughts y know -> My guy look at which politicians have taken money which influenced their votes that affected the American public My problem is anyone in the government that calls them swlf republican or Democrat because none of them seek to serve the people They write loop holes for one another to exploit while ignoring and blaiming the people If they want to serve companies first then they need to be removed With force if necessary
But u boutta get downvoted to HELL lol this is reddit -> Lmfao I don t care Are they going to tell on me to Joe Biden You know their supreme lord
you know I don t think schools should be teaching biased political shit in the first place Schools in the south teach fake conservative bullshit anyway there s no difference -> I agee
Both auditors check government officials in real time wipe on the field while lawyers do it on the court room -> I d absolutely love a link or some source about civil rights attorneys being right wing That would be fascinating My understanding is that a civil rights attorney would generally be considered woke at least according to the DeSantis definition of the word
Beto IS far left dude and Texans hate Austin as it is turning out like every single violent blue city in the US Crime in Austin alone makes up almost of the whole states crime Lol he blocked me -> Could you give me an example of the far left policy that Beto advocates for And crime in Austin makes up much less than of the whole states crime You know that isn t true They have a similar crime rate to Dallas and fewer people Come on at least try and argue in good faith Or at least if you re openly lying try and see why I might think you re misguided completely The perception that Austin is wildly dangerous is absolutely something being manufactured by news Please show the data that backs up this claim
Not sure how Title IX applies to speaking about your sexual preferences to year olds Nor violations in dress code -> The real thing we need to be punishing is the teaching of Christianity Teaching year olds about the delusion of a sky god that will cast them into a burning hell for not properly hating all the people their parents do should be considered a criminal act with a maximum sentence up to and including the death penalty There s also the issue of conservatism and Christianism being known mental disorders These people should not be allowed to practice their mental delusions in public or in private around children including wearing or otherwise displaying any symbols of their mental delusions
Wait you re telling me this whole time that going to public school didn t stop my rights That s kinda fucked so many times I could a used them -> public schools absolutely have the right to restrict speech and conduct searches scotus has been over the issue and you have less rights in school Its not that you dont have rights until you are tho
I absolutely can not wait to tell my son s teacher to only teach him the controversial stuff -> Right The minute all this bullshit started I was on overdrive with the boys lol Look at this And look at this Did you hear Know that s absurd Because here look at these Amendments lol A few of my son s teachers are actually quite good and they don t seem to give a shit about Abbott Thank God for sanity
I do the same It s the only way to give them the tools they will need for their futures right -> Yes My boys weren t taught daily living things either I had to go through bills home budgeting banking all of it We ve talked about sex health current events politics federal and state governments history english I guess you could say I ve been like a back up I d never homeschool them in a million years but I m a good follow up and bottom line kinda mom lmao
Our children -> I m not republican
Is that why adoption is big in religious circles -> I try not to think about that
I m currently suspended for days for threatening a teacher I obviously dont know the details but that doesnt seem like a denial to me and in this current climate you re honestly lucky that the teacher didnt just shoot you and claim self defense That s the proposed solution from GOP after all You shouldnt be threatening teachers Their job is insanely stressful right now and with school shootings being what they are a mental evaluation is the absolute least they can do -> The whole Nova scotia school system should be reevaluated I m not denying it I know what I said was wrong It was how I felt Taking his class has only made me okay with dropping out but neither the school nor my family will let me I just want to get out of school and on with my life
What did you do -> Fucker was rambling for minutes so I just left to go piss without saying shit cause fuck em Then I got sent to the office and went off on them about how I wanted to kill him and his class only adds stress to my life I mentioned I wanted to kill myself multiple times since taking his class stands between me and my future So now I m not allowed back at school until I get evaluated I think I was better off to keep my mouth shut
I had to take one of those for school related reasons It s easy they just ask a few random ass questions like Do you take drugs Do you have a good relationship with your family Do you have suicidal thoughts and my personal favorite Have you ever abused an animal before Just answer as a normal kid would and you will be alright Edit Actually I ve taken of them total A mental evaluation a psychosexual evaluation a CPS evaluation and two probation officer ones And I passed all of them So believe me when I say I have experience with this shit -> Yes great advice Tell the kid who is threatening his teacher how to pass a mental evaluation undetected You are a genius aren t you
I feel like you re making a point but I m either too uninformed or just not smart enough to figure it out Help -> its not you its him
Yes a moral and definitely unbiased Texas school board We should definitely believe that they have concerns about her -> it s not WHAT she s teachin it s THAT she s teachin
I m not grade teacher austin texas html -> What kind of rag article is this It doesn t even seem to look into the actual complaint just takes the teachers word for everything and then quotes internet comments with the last paragraph being straight up advocacy lmao
Saw it on local news to my understanding she compared the two and insinuated they re the same then told kids they don t have to participate I m against forced patriotism everyone has the right to not participate -> I mean do you not think the pledge of allegiance is propoganda Keep in mind that propoganda just means something that is intended to persuade an audience to a particular point of view it doesn t necesarily mean evil or even wrong it just means that it s something biased that is intended to push an agenda Are you familiar with the history of the pledge of allegiance The original version was literally authored by A Union Army officer who wrote books about how to teach patriotism in schools It is propaganda whether you personally believe that it is good propaganda or bad propaganda is a personal choice A comparison to Nazi propaganda which was certainly not voluntary would be a valuable lesson in how America in theory differs from authoritarian regimes such as the third reich And according to the one source that I could find that actually went into any detail on the issue they had just finished a unit on the Holocaust so it s not like she pulled the comparison out of thing air Relating the current subject to ones recently discussed is just good teaching If the teacher hadn t been fired for daring to point out that the pledge is propaganda and that the students are free to choose not to participate it could have been a valuable lesson in the differences between patriotism and fascism However the hamfisted actions of the school district probably taught those kids a very different lesson with regards to their local government
A republic is a system where the the people are in charge of the gov less government in our lives its why there is a voting system in a real republic we THE PEOPLE should be voting for more than a president we should be the ones voting on what the politicians are voting for on our behalf for us behind closed doors we all should know of every bill that s being passed Unfortunately that s not what s going on now -> Actually a republic is just any country that s not a monarchy It doesn t have to be democratic for that
Isn t that a problem specific to how the US screwed up public schooling though Public schools in general aren t to produce factory workers -> Correct That is why I am talking about the US public system when the post is about the US public system
look at children raised in different societies where public schools also socialize children into basic social behaviors and everyone also thinks the kids aren t learning enough -> i feel like the context is pretty clear that i meant the exact opposite of that kids aren t learning enough they re just being taught the wrong things in the wrong way its not an inherent problem with the concept of public education its the actual reality of those institutions at the time in history that we inhabit Just like there wasnt anything wrong with the concept of treating mental illness in the past it was a problem with how the institutions were just doing torture in the name of that goal
I m posing some questions that if you search for an answer will lead to understand my viewpoint -> Why would a factory worker be forced to take art English foreign language social studies history and science classes Go ahead
Well if you looked it up you d learn for yourself Kids today want everything spoon fed to them -> That s what I just said to him stupid
It isn t a public school s place to debate social and political issues They are there to teach mathematics reading language art etc I am a supporter of all human rights but school just isn t the place for that If you open up the possibility for it it can also be used to teach things you don t agree with For instance what if a state education board decided to teach against lgbtq rights instead of just not allowing the discussion at all If states codify teaching lgbtq rights opposing states will codify teaching anti lgbtq rights It opens the door to this That s why it s much more preferable to just leave schools out of it and teach your children about social and political issues yourself Schools don t change laws people do -> Of course it s not your rights that are up for grabs
Calling for common sense gun laws that don t even violate the second amendment is not vehemently opposing the second amendment That s the motte in the very clear motte and bailey routine going on Kind of like protecting freedom and doing nothing about our absurd level of gun violence are seemingly the same thing for NRA propaganda enthusiasts I ve been intrenched in this same debate for over a decade now personally For some it s much longer Gee why would anyone doubt your sincerity in only wanting minor gun law reform Total mystery Because the NRA wants it that way Simple They have you convinced that when I say common sense gun laws I actually want to restrict the rights of innocent people just because some criminals are criminals and oh by the way criminals don t follow laws anyway so what s the point Right -> Kind of like protecting freedom and doing nothing about our absurd level of gun violence are seemingly the same thing for NRA propaganda enthusiasts No That s not a motte and bailey Because the NRA wants it that way Simple They have you convinced that when I say common sense gun laws I actually want to restrict the rights of innocent people just because some criminals are criminals and oh by the way criminals don t follow laws anyway so what s the point Right No When people like you say common sense gun laws my normal response is to ask like what and in response I receive either vague concepts that are already on the books in many places like background checks waiting periods etc or ideas that won t actually do anything to stop gun violence like assault weapons bans Combined with the fact that many gun control laws DO get used to try to de facto ban guns I really don t trust you So I will ask you a simple question Would you support a law that banned all personal ownership of firearms Why or why not
I m not regurgitating Fox News everything s not that easy Corporate lobbyists benefit from overpolicing and building private prisons in gerrymandered voting districts and scary tabloid fear mongering That s why they love republicans Turning dipshit republicans into fascist terrorists and dividing their party into expendables and useables is furthering the agenda of disarming the populace for easier control It s bipartisan -> So who s trying to take your guns away Got any names and specific actions
Do you really think that private gun ownership would do anything at all if the fucking US military decided they wanted to come by door to door and kill every one of us Guns aren t saving us against the strongest military in the world -> million members of the US military vs million reported gun owners in the US Not every member of the military will be OK with killing the populace in fact most won t You ll probably lose a good chunk of the military if it was attempted Also we can probably assume that of gun owners don t report their gun ownership Even if every member of the military did participate in your scenario all it takes is each household killing member of the military during their murder campaign and the campaign will very quickly be over The military could try and use things like jets and tanks and bombs but my guess is that the collateral damage to non gun owners would be so great that these tools would quickly be abandoned in lieu of door to door gun grabs Then the door to door gun grabs would quickly be over through attrition via sheer numbers So yes guns are very much able to save us from the strongest military in the world
My guy look at which politicians have taken money which influenced their votes that affected the American public My problem is anyone in the government that calls them swlf republican or Democrat because none of them seek to serve the people They write loop holes for one another to exploit while ignoring and blaiming the people If they want to serve companies first then they need to be removed With force if necessary -> hey I m just asking questions So you re saying you can t answer them Or are you just gonna keep referring to this mysterious they when you think your rights are going to be taken away very Alex Jones bro
Could you give me an example of the far left policy that Beto advocates for And crime in Austin makes up much less than of the whole states crime You know that isn t true They have a similar crime rate to Dallas and fewer people Come on at least try and argue in good faith Or at least if you re openly lying try and see why I might think you re misguided completely The perception that Austin is wildly dangerous is absolutely something being manufactured by news Please show the data that backs up this claim -> His most famous one is banning all guns and going house to house with police and getting them that is a far left policy Also you are free to say exactly what percentage of crime Austin alone has compared to entirety Texas if you want to prove me wrong
The real thing we need to be punishing is the teaching of Christianity Teaching year olds about the delusion of a sky god that will cast them into a burning hell for not properly hating all the people their parents do should be considered a criminal act with a maximum sentence up to and including the death penalty There s also the issue of conservatism and Christianism being known mental disorders These people should not be allowed to practice their mental delusions in public or in private around children including wearing or otherwise displaying any symbols of their mental delusions -> The topic is her teaching outside the assigned curriculum to other people s children You re moving the goalposts to another subject The title of this thread is lacking critical information in an attempt to frame the argument in a particular direction
public schools absolutely have the right to restrict speech and conduct searches scotus has been over the issue and you have less rights in school Its not that you dont have rights until you are tho -> You can say what you want to say you just are not going to like the consequences probably You also are not free from searches on public property Just walking through a metal detector is a form of searching
could have -> People downvoting cuz they don t like csharp minor keys
I am pretty sure you can t do that -> Why not educate yourself instead of wasting your time spouting bullshit
Your rights don t take precedent over others numnuts They have the right to privacy you re just a narcissistic tool -> You don t have the right to privacy in public ya goober
Yes My boys weren t taught daily living things either I had to go through bills home budgeting banking all of it We ve talked about sex health current events politics federal and state governments history english I guess you could say I ve been like a back up I d never homeschool them in a million years but I m a good follow up and bottom line kinda mom lmao -> Sounds to me like the school is the back up Great job by you and inspiring too
Lmao at the teacher didn t just shoot you how disconnected from the real world do you uave to be to even consider that Bonus points for somehow shoving in political parties -> Lmao at the teacher didn t just shoot you how disconnected from the real world do you uave to be You know what s crazy I agree with you I think that s an insane notion I think its equally insane to have to assume that the kid making threats might want to shoot a teacher as well Unfortunately the world is a crazy place right now Pretending these things arent happening and that those arent legitimate positions by certain legislators is to be willfully ignorant You can keep your bonus points I dont feel like celebrating
Fucker was rambling for minutes so I just left to go piss without saying shit cause fuck em Then I got sent to the office and went off on them about how I wanted to kill him and his class only adds stress to my life I mentioned I wanted to kill myself multiple times since taking his class stands between me and my future So now I m not allowed back at school until I get evaluated I think I was better off to keep my mouth shut -> Nah Better that you spoke up and now you re getting a mental evaluation
Yes great advice Tell the kid who is threatening his teacher how to pass a mental evaluation undetected You are a genius aren t you -> At least they aren t being a patronizing ass like you
I know what I said was wrong Did I care No I wanted him gone Out of my life I saw him as a symbol of everything between me being miserable currently and enjoying the rest of my life Do you wonder why I wanted to kill him -> If you want to kill anyone at all you might be better away from the general population
I ve smelled it both ways -> I peed a little
Their iconic song it s not natural -> And their follow up just keep it behind closed doors
The poster is complaining about imaginary bigots essentially asserting their personal biases as truth to smear a group they don t like with no evidence -> I wouldn t call legislation that is being passed no evidence There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that hatred for the LGBTQ community is alive and festering
What kind of rag article is this It doesn t even seem to look into the actual complaint just takes the teachers word for everything and then quotes internet comments with the last paragraph being straight up advocacy lmao -> It s a school in texas they do not deserve the benefit of the doubt
It s Nazi adjacent That s what nationalism is the idea that a country is the best there is regardless of what it stands for or what it does because you had the divine luck to be born there and anyone who wasn t born there isn t a true insert country here Add religion and racism that s Nazi Germany -> There s European nationalism and then there s American nationalism which really is just civic nationalism Think about this for a second we have borders and haven t been to war with them for quite some time
Why would a factory worker be forced to take art English foreign language social studies history and science classes Go ahead -> I don t have a non anecdotal answer to that but here s some stats The US used to have a significant percent of labor force in manufacturing over US schools really emphasize punctuality attendance following schedules and deadlines which are all useful traits in a factory worker The point is that the school system is very old and emphasizes traits that are not necessarily useful in today s economy
That s what I just said to him stupid -> You re stupid
Of course it s not your rights that are up for grabs -> How would you even know that
million members of the US military vs million reported gun owners in the US Not every member of the military will be OK with killing the populace in fact most won t You ll probably lose a good chunk of the military if it was attempted Also we can probably assume that of gun owners don t report their gun ownership Even if every member of the military did participate in your scenario all it takes is each household killing member of the military during their murder campaign and the campaign will very quickly be over The military could try and use things like jets and tanks and bombs but my guess is that the collateral damage to non gun owners would be so great that these tools would quickly be abandoned in lieu of door to door gun grabs Then the door to door gun grabs would quickly be over through attrition via sheer numbers So yes guns are very much able to save us from the strongest military in the world -> I disagree with a lot of this but I don t think you re dumb We may just disagree Re military members not following orders I think you overestimate how many people would be deflecting We already kill innocent people all over the globe and our militarized police have no problem killing innocent US citizens during peaceful protests I don t think the magnitude of military members defying orders out of the goodness of their heart would be very large If the government truly wanted to come after us I think they would absolutely be wiping cities off the face of the map not just going after gun owners individually and trying to reduce collateral damage Again we ve done that all over the world Overall my point is that if the US government decided it would be beneficial to them and their goals they could easily kill any citizen they wanted to and armed civilians which are only of Americans won t make an impact on their tanks military grade guns striker drones bombs etc Its not going to be shootouts it would be them flattening any and all dissidents with ease The pro gun argument of we need private gun ownership so we can defend ourselves against the government became outdated decades ago in my opinion No one can beat the US military unfortunately I think this is a huge issue in and of itself One additional piece of evidence that the government would easily destroy us is the fact that we have a fully militarized police force There are tanks military weapons etc in the hands of local police in NYC where I live our police budget is equal to the entire military budget of Vietnam They probably wouldn t even need to call in the national guard To be clear I am personally anti gun for many reasons but I can understand some pro gun arguments ex wanting protection for your home in the event of an intruder I just don t think this particular argument makes sense in a modern context
hey I m just asking questions So you re saying you can t answer them Or are you just gonna keep referring to this mysterious they when you think your rights are going to be taken away very Alex Jones bro -> php cycle ind k Here s the current list of they that I m talking about since you can t understand I m talking about Republicans and democrats Both parties ignore the people in favor of making money from corporations If you want an expanded list do some research or wait for me to get off work
Lol project much I don t think the left likes the old union buster anymore than you weirdos We just don t lie about him constantly lmao -> Besides I m assuming you still watch CNN Fox and abc
I wouldn t be surprised if they actually devoted their time to trying to get private counseling with him to say this internet man has a different opinion -> Ty you made my day
You can say what you want to say you just are not going to like the consequences probably You also are not free from searches on public property Just walking through a metal detector is a form of searching -> If you can say something but there are legal consequences are you really free to say it Social consequences are how we regulate speech in the majority of the US I d argue But a legally upheld consequence of speech is not contiguous with free speech
Similarly the Black Panthers had a right to walk around with rifles despite how uncomfortable that might have made people feel Selma freedom marchers had a right to demonstrate despite how much the locals might have resented it -> I would most definitely agree they had the right to do so You feeling uncomfortable about me using my rights is your own hang up not mine I support it even thought the shit can be annoying But that s the price of maintaining rights
Way to prove him right so quickly lmao -> The only thing proven here is how idiotic Americans are The citizens are a part of the state Dipshit McGee over here decided it s his right to search whoever the fuck he wants
Sounds to me like the school is the back up Great job by you and inspiring too -> Thank you so much but it s never really formal you know Our conversations happen everywhere lol Sometimes spontaneously
I promote education learning and critical thinking so my first recommendation is stay in school and use the school s resource to set yourself up for that awesome post school life Make connections plan your future get research done for you But if staying in school doesn t sound like it ll work you have the knowledge and are or near yr there is also the General Education Development GED certificate You ll still need to prove your knowledge and ability with English reading writing math science and social studies but is a high school equivalent certificate -> See here s the thing I turn before I graduate If i can get the GED before I graduate do I still have to finish school
I just want to get out of school and on with my life That will be a lot easier to do if you graduate I know that it sucks right now but it is honestly going to seem like a small blip on the timeline of your life and you re going to have a much harder time getting on with your life without it Dont rush life That s the quickest way to waste it -> Life isn t really that much easier after high school Most adults in the real world still act like they re teenagers and treat their now adult children as though they re still children under the age of eighteen
Yup Telling people how you really feel will more often than not only get you into more trouble Now you ve gotta take some bullshit evaluation Good luck my friend and please don t kill people -> Update on the situation Just gave a police statement and they understand I m just angry and want him gone The teacher is scared of me I guess he s uncomfortable with me in his class
At least they aren t being a patronizing ass like you -> I m being patronizing because it s completely irresponsible to encourage a child with anger issues to cheat on a test to see if they re a credible threat to fellow school children or staff members May I ask with all due respect are you fucking stupid
If you want to kill anyone at all you might be better away from the general population -> That s exactly what I want
I peed a little -> Both ways
And their follow up just keep it behind closed doors -> Can t forget my favorite Gaydioactive
It s a school in texas they do not deserve the benefit of the doubt -> That attitude is what is wrong with the world today
There s European nationalism and then there s American nationalism which really is just civic nationalism Think about this for a second we have borders and haven t been to war with them for quite some time -> Slippery slope between the two The average person wouldn t understand the subtle differences and there are hundreds of groups actively recruiting for the European version A lot on the right support patrolling the southern border with militias and allowing those militia to do horrible things That s just a war that hasn t been sanctioned by the government
I don t have a non anecdotal answer to that but here s some stats The US used to have a significant percent of labor force in manufacturing over US schools really emphasize punctuality attendance following schedules and deadlines which are all useful traits in a factory worker The point is that the school system is very old and emphasizes traits that are not necessarily useful in today s economy -> All of those traits are mandatory of every worker on every job
For the love of fuck pick up a history book pleeeeeeaaaase -> Another non response Trust me bro I can t explain it or articulate it in any way but I m really smart and know what I m talking about bro Pls you gotta believe me bro My evidence is because I said so bro Pls you gotta know history bro What a loser
You re stupid -> Good one dude You re quick as a whip
Lol they haven t made a tabloid strong enough for you have they -> Why don t you go ahead and answer his question instead of trying to change the subject Could it be because the word salad that has gooped out of your mouth is essentially nonsense No couldn t be
php cycle ind k Here s the current list of they that I m talking about since you can t understand I m talking about Republicans and democrats Both parties ignore the people in favor of making money from corporations If you want an expanded list do some research or wait for me to get off work -> so there s a list of lobbyist money Who s it from What s it for Where did it come from SO far you and others in this thread are just blathering about some mysterious they with no really clue about who you re even angry about The reason you SHOULD be angry is that you have no clue what s going on in the world but someone who runs a media company has made you mad about SOMETHING you just don t know what So you cling to vague bits and pieces of information that people who are also mad post on the internet This is what they mean by keeping you stupid and will do more damage to the country than any firearm regulation
I didn t feel like scrolling all the way down to the end of this thread so idk if this has already been answered but the they for me are people like the governor of Washington Jay Inslee Signed a bill yesterday that s would ban the manufacture sale and import of assault weapons into Washington It s not out right taking guns away but it s not hard to see that as being the next step To be fair not just him he only signed the bill so I d also include the state senate that passed it Also to be even more fair I did just Google this and came across a Fox News article so probably some nuance im missing -> It s not out right taking guns away but it s not hard to see that as being the next step Yes it is hard Gun nuts are so wrapped up in their obsession with owning whatever guns they want they see even sensible regulation as some kind of government over reach Can you own a miniGun A cruise missile a rocket launcher No Then you re happy that there s a line drawn where regulation is required We just disagree on where that line should be drawn
Besides I m assuming you still watch CNN Fox and abc -> That would require TV sir Only old people still pay for that Everyone else watches things that they actually enjoy on Netflix or Hulu or Amazon or Disney lmao
Ty you made my day -> There s nothing less beautiful than right wingers frotting together after one of them is brave enough to say something they both hope makes someone mad
If you can say something but there are legal consequences are you really free to say it Social consequences are how we regulate speech in the majority of the US I d argue But a legally upheld consequence of speech is not contiguous with free speech -> If you yell bomb while in an airport you ABSOLUTELY should have many consequences all I m sayin
I would most definitely agree they had the right to do so You feeling uncomfortable about me using my rights is your own hang up not mine I support it even thought the shit can be annoying But that s the price of maintaining rights -> The most annoying part about defending a right any right is that you spend most of your time defending people who don t deserve it because whenever a government tries to curtail a right it always goes for those people first to set a precedent This is why we have to put up with e g paparazzi existing because the right to record and photograph in public is extremely important see every cell phone video exposing police corruption But I m surprised the upskirt camera guy got away with it because although you have no expectation of privacy in public I would think that you do have an expectation of privacy regarding everything inside your clothing A reasonable person would not regard wearing a skirt as consent to have your upper thighs and undergarments photographed Not including the Black Panthers being armed as an example of people who don t deserve it BTW
Life isn t really that much easier after high school Most adults in the real world still act like they re teenagers and treat their now adult children as though they re still children under the age of eighteen -> Exactly So thinking that you re above all the teenager stuff and being desperate to get started on your life by skipping out on a good foundation is a very foolish mindset
Update on the situation Just gave a police statement and they understand I m just angry and want him gone The teacher is scared of me I guess he s uncomfortable with me in his class -> Consider yourself lucky that they let you get off scot free I ve had teachers file police reports against me for spamming their online classes and I was charged with harassment Threatening to take someone s life because they didn t let you go to the bathroom is something I would have expected to end way worse
Can t forget my favorite Gaydioactive -> I m not uptight not unattractive Turn me loose tonight cause I m
removed -> Unless they re a conservative in which case bring out the child brides Edit since it was deleted their reply was you re a pedophile you don t deserve benefit of the doubt
Slippery slope between the two The average person wouldn t understand the subtle differences and there are hundreds of groups actively recruiting for the European version A lot on the right support patrolling the southern border with militias and allowing those militia to do horrible things That s just a war that hasn t been sanctioned by the government -> It s really not hard to differentiate You do know that the left has authoritarians as well
All of those traits are mandatory of every worker on every job -> Yeah I m struggling to see how punctuality attendance and being on schedule are negative traits
You have an extremely pessimistic and shallow view of the world lol of all school systems in the world emphasise punctuality attendance following schedules and deadlines because it s a system that works It may not be perfect and there are ways to improve it but to draw the conclusion that it must be created that way to create factory workers is just absurd -> In the US they are prioritized over academics and also your claim is false In third world countries where children do not have regular or safe transport to school they attend only when they can meaning they show up when they show up
Good one dude You re quick as a whip -> I wasnt trying to be rude at all the public education system in the US was created explicitly to make factory workers and break childrens individuality
Why don t you go ahead and answer his question instead of trying to change the subject Could it be because the word salad that has gooped out of your mouth is essentially nonsense No couldn t be -> I m not going to watch the news for you you have to do that yourself
It s not out right taking guns away but it s not hard to see that as being the next step Yes it is hard Gun nuts are so wrapped up in their obsession with owning whatever guns they want they see even sensible regulation as some kind of government over reach Can you own a miniGun A cruise missile a rocket launcher No Then you re happy that there s a line drawn where regulation is required We just disagree on where that line should be drawn -> I hear your point but you can own a mini gun and rocket launcher in most states with a proper license
That would require TV sir Only old people still pay for that Everyone else watches things that they actually enjoy on Netflix or Hulu or Amazon or Disney lmao -> We don t want or need the constant rage bait unlike you
Yea see all that crazy stuff That s what I mean If someone broke the law and you can prove it in court Great If not please shut up lol pretty simple stuff -> It takes a prosecutor to prosecute someone They have to decide to Just because there s evidence doesn t mean the will Also the lack of evidence doesn t stop them either It s kinda like they are corrupt or something
From the perspective of someone outside of the US I gotta say it s both entertaining and majorly unsettling how unhinged some of the stuff you say about your politicians is -> We actually hade these freedoms unlike many other countries
The most annoying part about defending a right any right is that you spend most of your time defending people who don t deserve it because whenever a government tries to curtail a right it always goes for those people first to set a precedent This is why we have to put up with e g paparazzi existing because the right to record and photograph in public is extremely important see every cell phone video exposing police corruption But I m surprised the upskirt camera guy got away with it because although you have no expectation of privacy in public I would think that you do have an expectation of privacy regarding everything inside your clothing A reasonable person would not regard wearing a skirt as consent to have your upper thighs and undergarments photographed Not including the Black Panthers being armed as an example of people who don t deserve it BTW -> The most annoying part about defending a right any right is that you spend most of your time defending people who don t deserve it Spot on In fact I d say the vast majority of rights I defend are people that don t deserve it Especially Mr Upskirt guy What s the old saying I may not agree with you but I ll die defending your right to do it
Exactly So thinking that you re above all the teenager stuff and being desperate to get started on your life by skipping out on a good foundation is a very foolish mindset -> School didn t feel like a very good foundation tbh This is coming from someone who was bullied a bunch as a kid and I tried speaking out and either got punished by my peers for snitching or punished by teachers for defending myself because ZeRo ToLeRaNcE PoLiCiEs Zero Tolerance policies are another BS tool used by teachers to punish the kids who are being bullied rather than punish the kid who s performing the act of bullying
Consider yourself lucky that they let you get off scot free I ve had teachers file police reports against me for spamming their online classes and I was charged with harassment Threatening to take someone s life because they didn t let you go to the bathroom is something I would have expected to end way worse -> I just got back from the mental evaluation Turns out I m not mentally ill so I m not sure what to tell the school
It s really not hard to differentiate You do know that the left has authoritarians as well -> Of course go too far left and you get communism It s not hard for intelligent people but it s easy to accept some really horrible things as patriotism of you re not aware of the differences For example look what DeSantis is doing in Florida with CRT and woke He can t accurately define either one and neither can his supporters but they can hear what he s really whistling
In the US they are prioritized over academics and also your claim is false In third world countries where children do not have regular or safe transport to school they attend only when they can meaning they show up when they show up -> If you have to look at the extreme end of the spectrum just to prove a point your point isn t very useful At that point you re not even talking about the education system anymore You re talking about extreme poverty and its effects on local infrastructure You can travel all over Africa and see very similar schooling systems to the US minus the resources They still want you to show up on time they still have homework and deadlines and they still want you to be in school In fact a lot of schools that I saw in Africa and India were even more strict than American schools India especially can be very strict when it comes to education
I wasnt trying to be rude at all the public education system in the US was created explicitly to make factory workers and break childrens individuality -> That s a baseless idiotic statement and if you are arguing that s what it was like during the Industrial Revolution It s fucking Wake up Kids don t even have to take tests anymore Schools now are a daycare center
I m not going to watch the news for you you have to do that yourself -> A non answer is just as telling I do appreciate you being honest about your stupidity though Please tell your invisible bogeyman that I said hello and Enjoy the day
I hear your point but you can own a mini gun and rocket launcher in most states with a proper license -> mini gun and rocket launcher in most states with a proper license ok mini guns yes provided it was made before and you re willing to undergo an extremely extensive background check But missiles or even anything that explodes No Those are classed as destructive devices and are federally illegal explosives Hell even a glass bottle filled with gasoline and a rag for a fuse is illegal and you ll do jail time for possessing it So yeah there is a line We just disagree where it is BTW I have no issue with responsible gun ownership I would just like to see some sensible regulations applied Like everywhere else in the civilized world
We don t want or need the constant rage bait unlike you -> I don t watch that crap either I m up here just like y all
It takes a prosecutor to prosecute someone They have to decide to Just because there s evidence doesn t mean the will Also the lack of evidence doesn t stop them either It s kinda like they are corrupt or something ->
