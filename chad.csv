"The comments here are concerning üíÄ

Japan was not nuked to save American lives, America already won the war. The specifics of why are argued by historians- some say it was to ensure a more absolute surrender, some say it was to ease control of Japan under America, some say it was to show American dominance among the allies, but the most common explanation is that it was a show of force against soviets who had just entered the war to control as much of the region as possible. If it was because the japanese wouldn't have surrendered, they'd nuke... Tokyo. 

And no, this doesn't somehow absolve imperial Japan of their crimes. They were far worse than America throughout the course of the war, arguably worse than Nazi Germany, but that doesn't make nuking civilians ok in the way internment camps weren't ok.",To save American lives is definetly one of the reasons for the nukes. It can be debated whether or not it was justified but the facts are that a mainland invasion of Japan would be costly
Japan of all countries seems to have the shittiest luck. Constantly at war in the past and then nuked twice.,A mainland invasion would have been worse for Japan than 2 nukes

I love my great grandfather, and I'd rather him with us than a framed purple heart of a great man I'd never have the privilege to know.

"I'm saying that the US is the only country that used nuclear bombs, and Japan experienced it.

"Many historians say it was actually Russia declaring war on Japan, and not the atomic bombs, that convinced them to surrender

*EDIT:* Adding my academic sources since y‚Äôall are skeptical. 

‚ÄúGen. Anami on Aug. 13 remarked that the atomic bombings were no more menacing than the fire-bombing that Japan had endured for months.‚Äù 

- [Ward Wilson in Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/)

‚ÄúPrime Minister Kantaro Suzuki explained on Aug. 13 that Japan had to surrender quickly because ‚Äúthe Soviet Union will take not only Manchuria, Korea, Karafuto, but also Hokkaido. This would destroy the foundation of Japan. We must end the war when we can deal with the United States.‚Äù

[Historians Gar Alperovitz and Martin Sherwin](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-08-05/hiroshima-anniversary-japan-atomic-bombs)

‚ÄúEven Anami‚Äôs fantastic suggestion that the United States had more than 100 atomic bombs and planned to bomb Tokyo next did not change the opinions of either the peace party or the war party at all.

Rather, what decisively changed the views of the Japanese ruling elite was the Soviet entry into the war. It catapulted the Japanese government into taking immediate action. For the first time, it forced the government squarely to confront the issue of whether it should accept the Potsdam terms.‚Äù

"It also shows the country is not strong military wise.

It's like bringing a gun to a fist fight.",It's like bringing a suicide vest to a fist fight.
I‚Äôm pretty sure japn doesn‚Äôt make nukes because it‚Äôs in a treaty with the us,"This is the answer. Most Asian countries are in a non proliferation treaty with the United States. It's why the RoK, Japan, Australia, NZ, and plenty of other countries over there don't have nuclear weapons. 

The issue with that is, when a rogue state, like NK, starts creating their arsenal, a whole new set of problems arise. Now a lot of people in the RoK, a plurality of the population, think they should go nuclear. The US isn't seen as the unbeatable protector anymore, and so these non proliferation treaties may be out the window soon. 

Is the answer to do away with all of them? Make a shit ton more? That's up for debate. Should countries continue to rely on US protection, or arm up to protect themselves if things get bad? 

The geopolitical landscape of the world is changing as we speak. It's getting harder to see how things will stand at the end of the decade, much less farther out than that."

But I know that the mentality and the reason of the US (leaders) are changed, based on what I see, in worse.

There are too many things that are not right.","At the time, it was use nukes and hopefully scare Japan into surrendering or doing a mainland invasion of Japan which had horrifically high casualty projections since the Japanese would likely have fought to the end. Projected casualties for us forces were at least in the hundreds of thousands (interesting fact is that the us still gives out purple hearts originally made for this planned invasion because of how many losses were expected) and much more for Japanese and Japanese civilians."

I agree!  OP is focused on what happened 78 years ago and not what's happening in 2023.,"I mean the meme as a meme is pretty funny, not gonna lie. Im not sure if OP is purposefully trying to make a political statement or if they simply meant it as a funny bit of irony."

"That's a common myth, there was no indication japan was about to surrender. The us chose to use nukes instead of the planned invasion which would have had a lot more casualties on both sides (but especially the japanese). The fact that it was a show of force against the soviets is true, but that was just one of the reasons for using them",Japan wanted to conditionally surrender
"This is misinformation. At best, the standing military splintered (which it did) with some of them defecting and surrendering, and the main imperial military and the emperor himself remaining defiant.",https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/atomic-bombings-japan-did-not-produce-its-surrender-204074

"If you don't have something that enemy will fear, then the enemy will come for you and your things. It's how the world works.","Yeah, normal military does that job just fucking fine. No reason to desecrate an entire city with invisible poison for a decade or more.

"Nuclear weapons keep the world at peace. The only reason another Napoleon or Hitler can't happen again, is that when everybody is capable of mutually assured destruction, there is no point in conquest wars.","I think we already have another one of those, in Putin of Russia yoinking Ukraine.

"im not saying any bombing is justified, but this one was - japan was performing some disgusting atrocities during this time and america bombing japan is completely justified. for what japan was doing (nanking massacre, cannibalism, australian nurses massacre, pearl harbour and many other atrocities) - bombing japan is completely fair and justified.","All these atrocities were carried out by Japanese army not their civilians

Bombing of civilians can't be justified in any way, there can be no exceptions to this.
If US can justify nuking innocent old, youngs and kids to ashes using the pretext of self defence or ending up war.

Putin is fair and can justify bombing Ukrainians as he is trying to keep away nato from its borders its a self defence and tomorrow he nukes up Ukraine it would be fair as it will end up the war.

Bin laden was fair and justified as he attacked US civilians only to take revenge against US as they were bombing up middle east and carrying out atrocities on civilians.

Rules should be same for everyone without any exceptions.

Stop living the myth that only US enemies carry out atrocities when US did the same throughout the history

Japanese soldiers bodies were all mutilated equally and women were raped they attacked the civilian and killed families and took their family swords as possession. After ww2 1/5 of the Japanese family swords were in US as the soldiers brought them home looting the families they killed. They are even available today.

Several thousand women were raped in iraq, syria and Afghanistan by US soldiers, Civilians were killed and not a single soldier were convicted for these atrocities over years. They even opend fire from helicopter on Civilians to kill a single target and 23 innocent by standers all while laughing about it and those personal were removed from service and let go on bail while the reporter who released the video was jailed for leaking sensitive video"

As someone from Vermont the idea of billboards is crazy to me. You know when it‚Äôs a good time to distract people with advertisements? When they‚Äôre piloting a metal death machine that kills more people annually than over double the population of Vermont.,It certainly doesn't help that this death machine explodes on destruction and is often piloted by people unfit
I live in Maine and they banned them in the late 70‚Äôs or early 80‚Äôs. I remember the highway was littered with them before that. Good for Vermont!,Naw they've been banned in Vermont since 1968. This isn't news

How the hell are you supposed to get you‚Äôre ads while driving now?,"Pfft. Whilst on your phone and also the radio has em too.

"This is how cringe Reddit can be. This is how easy the most rotten material gets past the censors. Of course there are censors, Reddit cannot be a cesspool. I say often, Reddit has the best information on the internet but it also has the worst cringe. The advertisers are wise to spend their money here but the censors need to work harder.

This post suggests that (the) American pleasure spectrum is exhausted. Even beer and wine and spiced rum with coke and ""Camel"" cigarettes and Cuban cigars. People are focused like a laserbeam on defecation. Uber-wealthy people sit back and drink Scotch bourbon. You can afford ""Glenfidditch"" at least. That drink is life changing.

Maybe you should do a writing project and make a list of all the pleasures from A through Z. Don't forget the bakery and the pastry shop. Have you heard of a $12 French pastry like Gateau Noisettes ? What about caramel flan ? Then there is walking in the park in the July heat, and everything is green, and the sun beats down.",schizopost

"Yeah, I went on PH and it had Trans porn listed as the 2nd most searched/watched category‚Ä¶right under family porn. No, those are not the top things most people look up and we all know it lol.

Hate that website. Not a problem with porn. I have a problem with the fetishing on there. Trans and lesbian people have become a fetish on that website. I mean literally all the trans videos have the fucking t slur in the title. Fetishization is not the same as representation,"Porn is a fetish on its own. Everything  about it is fetishized. That‚Äôs the point.

It‚Äôs the trans actors‚Äô fault for making the porn. They agreed to to do it and represent their community their community in porn, get mad at them. They could‚Äôve joined a respectable industry and actually contributed to society, but they chose not too."

"The coal vs nuclear power debate is strong evidence of how media sensationalism ruins the public discourse. 

Coal really only have one thing going for it, and that is being cheap. Otherwise it's killed more people both directly and indirectly, it pollutes more harmful chemicals, it is worse in terms of greenhouse gases, and it makes you reliant on other countries resources unless you produce it yourself (nearly all countries in the world could mine uranium, it's just cheaper not to).","Not to mention, run out of Uranium, you get Thorium instead (ofc it'll take a bit of rebuilding but in if done smart won't be an issue).

"Except that Germany doesn't build new coal power plants. We're now behind China, India, Japan, and the US in terms of coal power. It's more about mining than burning it.

Them shutting down nuclear plants to burn coal is something I just don't think I can ever understand.,They want to shut down coal too. they already closed mines up so you can't get the coal anymore. And they are planning to destroy the nuclear power plants so when a new government should come that they can't simply turn them back on

These reactors were built in 1988 and 1989, I don't know how long they could have been operated, but I'm guessing they have been shut down at some point either way.

Also factor in here the time it can take for german bureaucracy to do it's thing."
Does anyone know the exact reason Germany did so? I personally am skeptical of nuclear but it‚Äôs definitely better than coal and non renewables,Well a lot of the older generation pushed for the regulation of  it and they knew nuclear as a cold war threat and cathastrophies in ukraine/japan. It was before the wide public saw co2 as the devil so they fought the thing that they saw as worst part of energy production back then and stand by that sentiment till today
"Go nuclear!
Go green!
Glowing green...","*Concentred natural glowing green metal go brr*

"Can someone explain the reasoning here?  I was under the impression that Germany was a world leader in renewable energy sources, to the point where they lost a lot of money on inefficient versions of the technology.","According to some people in the comment section, the nuclear power is going to be replaced by renewables. Also, while some people will be quick to praise new safer nuclear reactors, these power plants were simply not using those kinds of reactors"
"Meanwile in the (german) canteen heared from my co-worker:

""we do all the CO2 savings while other countrys dont care blow out coal like crazy. Everyone is loughing at us since we are the only one so stupid to save CO2""",India and China
Except China is the biggest carbon polluter with more than the next 4 countries combined and they are building on average two new coal plants every week and plan on increasing that number. Germany is #6 on that list.,"China may be the biggest polluter, but that not entirely its own fault. Many production are being outsourced to china, so pollution that would normally happen in other countries now happens in china, ""inflating"" the amount of carbon emissions from china."
Why is everyone demonizing co2?,"Nobody hates Carbon Dioxide, they just hate that there is so much that there is a byproduct. If I gave you a cup of water, you'd be happy. If I gave you 80 bottles of water, you'd be happy if you stockpiled and didn't recieve more for a bit. If I gave you The Ocean, you would drown in your hatred for me. You were given water that was inherently good, but too much caused a negative byproduct (Real life being Heat, this scenario being lack of Oxygen)"
The worst part is that coal puts out far more radiation than nuclear power plants,Got a source on that?
"Chernobyl and its consequences have soured an entire generation towards nuclear power when the culprit was actually the inefficiency of Soviet power plants. It‚Äôs a shame, too. Nuclear power is our best solution against global warming.",Not inefficiency but human failure.
Shame on you OP for being such a bold faced liar. Germany is still reducing emissions and most of the nuclear capacity was replaced by renewables.,Was it really? Afaik we just started our coal factories because of lack of energy. Our government is fucking us sideways and people are happy about it
FYI CO2 makes up 0.04% off earth‚Äôs atmosphere. man-made climate change is a meme,Its a scam to make money thats all

Also the amount of pollutants by country is FAR worse outside of the west simply by China and quickly growing to be India. Most countries in the world do not have ANY care to go green. Furthermore how are you going to trust the reports of these countries who regardless of their actual practices are incentivized by the west to be green despite it being bad for them?","Yeah I'm sorry it was indeed very misleading to say ""eVeRY cOuNtRy"" 
When making the meme I just didn't gave much attention and it seems like I say that Germany make the most Co2 emissions, but it was about Germany's politicians saying that they do their best for the environment despite highly increasing their coal usage.  
So yeah saying ""eVeRY cOuNtRy"" for the paris agreement is so fucking dumb and ethnocentric  
and now everyone repeat thing that I already know in the comments because I failed my only task to do a proper caption."
And the problem is?,"Idk, the warming climate that is going to destroy millions of lives at the very least, if not completely annihilate humanity...

but this meme was about the incoherence of Germany's politicians saying that they do their best for the environment while they actually increased a lot their coal usage. 
But you're right by the fact that saying in the meme ""every country"" was clearly misleading, and I am sorry."
What's the matter with bi-atomic cobalt?,Wouldn't it be di-atomic?
Yeah. There is always China and India who will easily dwarf Germany,America too but the lowered their output by a really big amount
Where did the rumor come from that Germany is increasing fossile fuel consumption to compensate for the (archaic) nuclear power plants shutting down? They made up a negligible amount of Germany energy consumption anyways.,Negliable? They were putting out around 30% and more before shutdown increasingly lowering their output. we are just buying the missing energy now from other countries like France which LITERALLY BUILT 3 NEW NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS at the border to Germany so they can sell it to us.
Fym ‚Äúevery country‚Äù lmao what,"I'm sorry, that was misleading. 
It was about the paris agreement, and how Germany's politicians say that they od their best for the environment but have increased their coal usage for electricity production. 
 
Of course China makes the highest carbon emissions with their worldwide industry, and saying ""eVeRY cOuNtRy"" was indeed dumb."
China the Philippines and India:,"I know that Germany is really not the worst. 
Saying ""eVeRY cOuNtRy"" was stupid misleading and I am sorry. I was talking about Germany's politics saying that they do their best for the environment, while Highly increasing their coal consumption.

"Ye, coal power plants emit more radionuclides than nuclear power plants. Like, how dafuq there are people who say NPPs are radioactive?",They think the steam comes in contact with the uranium. That‚Äôs assuming they know that it‚Äôs steam from the towers and not smoke or something.
correct me if i am wrong but the only gas that comes from nuclear power is steam from the water heating right?,"Yep, but even including contaminants from the extraction and refinement of the uranium itself and the spent fuel, coal is dirtier."
"I'll go one step further, if you are opposed to both fracking for natural gas & nuclear power, and to be clear you might have good reasons for doing so; but if you do oppose, then I believe you must accept one of two possibilities.  


1. We cannot and should not expect to counteract the effects of Global Warming
2. Or the world must revert from it's industrial first world model back to something resembling the agricultural age.

I do not see how you expect to meet the energy needs of the modern world with solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydro electric power.  They are too inefficient & inconsistent.  

&#x200B;

* Solar doesn't work everywhere and is inefficient for the landmass it takes up.
* Similarly hydro electric is region locked and doesn't work for landlocked states/countries.
* Geothermal is probably the most expensive to produce for the amount generated, has hyper specific land requirements, and isn't proven to burn as clean as natural gas.
* Wind tech wears out easily, and creates a lot of polluting plastics such as windmill rotos.
* Biomass can lead to massive deforestation to meet our current energy requirements.  


  
So for every one arguing coal bad, nuclear bad, fracking bad.  Ok fair enough but what do we do instead?  What's your ultimate goal here?  You can't just say ""thing bad, let's stop it"" you have to evaluate the costs, because something has got to give in this discussion.","Interesting thing about hydropower is the very few see it as a dangerous source of power. Even though it is one of the most dangerous ones due to the risk of dam failure.

Everyone has heard about Chernobyl, which killed a dozen or so directly and possibly (at worst) a few thousand indirectly. But how many had heard about the Banqiao Dam failure of 1975? This killed between 85'600 directly and about 140'000 indirectly as well as destroying at least 5 million homes."
"We literally just destroyed another town to get more lignite so we can produce more cars. Which seems bad since air pollution kills a lot of people each year. I‚Äôm not sure if we have had a single nuclear reactor related death in Germany.

But at least now we can feel even more self righteous when we lecture the French about their nuclear reactors.",I was down voted elsewhere a few weeks ago for bringing up that Germany was even using lignite. Worse than coal.
"nUt nUvLear wAasrte !!

Like burrying shit kilometers underground in secure vault is in any way dangerous lol. Also pretty sure our food causes more cancers than all the serious nuclear incidents ever (a grand total of 2). 

Honestly I fucking hate what the world has become, everything is fucking dumb. When I was growing up I expected people in charge to do the logical/best thing, I'm 29 now and what a rude fucking awakening its been. Fuck.","Except it is dangerous and that's why it's so tough finding a spot. Germany thought they were safe, then it turns out water was getting into their waste storage and now the have to move it all.

If it were just that simple then it would have been solved by now. Significantly smarter people than you have been working on it."
"I know that's not what you meant, but by coal directly killing people I imagined a coal piece with a gun",No you just breath it in
"But is it cheap?

Building a coal power plant is cheaper than nuclear one, but is it cheaper to run and fuel? I would say no. And uranium basically has no other use than for this","I'm going by the lifetime cost. Though of course we know nuclear power plants can be run way beyond their planned lifetime, as that is the case with many built in the 70s. The uranium is, as you say, not the major expense."
today cheapest energy source is solar. only thing coal has going for it is that it's there and you don't need to Invest much you just keep it running,"Only if you do not factor the cost of compensating for irregularity, and then wind is cheaper.

One of the greatest fallacies of wind and solar is to take for granted that someone else will produce power when wind and solar cannot. But really, what it means if that for every kW of solar you need a kW capacity of some other power source. That or pay up for storage capacity. Right now consumers absorb the cost by paying extortionate prices during low wind (and solar) availability.

And sure, nuclear need maintenance but that maintenance is in nearly all cases predictable and even flexible."
"Yeah Germany is replacing the nuclear with renewables, which reddit has suddenly decided to hate.","> which reddit has suddenly decided to hate.

Reddit didn't suddenly start hating renewables, it finally recognized the concept of ""base load"" and that without significant advances in battery technology, renewables cannot service that need. We are simply sick of the renewable sycophants who think real life is like a game of SimCity where you can just spam wind turbines down and everything is hunky dory. When these people start talking shit about nuclear, ignorantly, we tend to clap back at them pretty hard, and I suppose you could misconstrue that as ""suddenly deciding to hate renewables""."
https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germany-fires-up-extra-coal-power-capacity-plug-winter-supplies-2022-11-02/,"None of that contradicts my comment. We didn't build any new ones, just kept using the ones we had.

Turns out you gotta get your power somewhere when your biggest supplier cuts you off."
'we are behind these 4 countries with at least 1.5 times our population and are famously terrible for emissions' doesn't really mean a lot.,"All those countries still build new coal power plants wich is my actual point. 

Edit: except for the US."
It's more like: politicians go ok who is gonna pay me the most?,"I guess russian cheap gas was too good to say no. In fact, it was too good to say yes to nucelar (yes, I said nucelar)"
The dumb ass climate activists*,Real climate activists know that Nuclear is better for the environment
They want to shut down coal too. they already closed mines up so you can't get the coal anymore. And they are planning to destroy the nuclear power plants so when a new government should come that they can't simply turn them back on,"What a stupid decision... Until they can rely 100% on renewable energy, or if we eventually crack contained nuclear fusion, then nuclear fission is by far the safest and most effective energy source...Destroying these nuclear plants would set their goals for fixing climate change back years."
"Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll explain it since literally no one understands it apparently
Our rivers are LITERALLY too hot most of the year to run nuclear power
We LITERALLY cannot use nuclear power
Which is why Austria, France, Spain, Denmark, and so many other countries REGULARLY import power from Germany
France for example has 50% of their nuclear power plants offline at all times because they can‚Äôt run them
And if we wanted to use them, we would kill everything living in those rivers because if they get too warm they can‚Äôt store oxygen anymore
Which is why those plants will be replaced by renewable energy (which on some days was already 90% of our powersource)",Thank you this makes more sense than ecolobbies went wild ...

">Closing nuclear power plants is a bit silly

These reactors were built in 1988 and 1989, I don't know how long they could have been operated, but I'm guessing they have been shut down at some point either way.

>These things can take 15 -20 years to build.

Also factor in here the time it can take for german bureaucracy to do it's thing.",I imagine they could extend the life of the plants by replacing the steam generators of each unit. But that is also a factor. Red tape and compliance issues can add to that
"The public opinion on nuclear energy here is quite bad. U know, fukushima and Tschernobyl. After the disaster of Tschernobyl, most people realised how dangerous nuclear power plants can be. I'm skeptical of nuclear too but like u said, better than coal, etc. Unfortunatly we've got problems in terms of managing when it comes to renewables...i hope that changes.

Edit: I'm skeptical towards nuclear power plants because of more than Fukushima and Tschernobyl. I know that modern reactors are safer but there's always room for failures. And i dont really want to be near a power plant if that happens","Modern nuclear reactors are the cleanest and safest form of energy we have at the moment. Both the Fukushima and Chernobyl meltdowns were due to poor design. Not to mention that Fukushima only killed 1 person, the rest of the deaths were due to the massive tsunami. Literally almost any form of energy is more deadly than nuclear, and nuclear being dangerous is an illusion created by media"
"While they indeed increase their renewable energy source parts, they also have closed all their nuclear power plant and replace them with coal power plant, which is the fossil fuel that basically pollute the most. 
So they have highly increased their Co2 emissions while their politicians are saying that they do the maximum for the environment. 
 
Of course Germany's actions is not the biggest problem for the climate, of course, but Its problematic considering the fact that they say indeed that they do their best. 
Love to German peoples fighting aigainst the destruction of that town to create a coal mine. 
 
That was the subject of the meme.","They did not replace them with coal, they simply closed them according to what was agreed on decades ago. 
The majority of closed plants wouldn't have gotten the permission to continue running due to safety regulations anyway.


Ofc it's true that there's a problem with coal mining and coal plants, but that isn't related."
"Of course! 
But this meme was about the increase of coal usage in Germany. 
Tho you can use this image to make a meme about china's high fossil fuel usage!","But coal usage is not increasing?! Thats because your meme is dumb. Pls at least to check the ""fact"" you're building your memes on..."
"Nobody hates Carbon Dioxide, they just hate that there is so much that there is a byproduct. If I gave you a cup of water, you'd be happy. If I gave you 80 bottles of water, you'd be happy if you stockpiled and didn't recieve more for a bit. If I gave you The Ocean, you would drown in your hatred for me. You were given water that was inherently good, but too much caused a negative byproduct (Real life being Heat, this scenario being lack of Oxygen)","Okay. But the global warming isnt as bad as some people out there go about promoting. Which is what I dont understand. Climate change is just that. Change. The amount of heat and co2 being generated isnt bad. Its actually showing more greening on the planet. There have been studies on co2 and plant growth before. And the added heat over the entire planet as a whole is more so what people should be focusing on when it comes to that topic. They want to talk about the climate change? Look at the overall increase over not just a couple decades because that doesnt matter. You have to go back thousands of years to understand the planets climate. There has been times when the entire planet has been snowball earth yes. But millions of years ago. Its also been tropical.

I am not pro pollution. Clean up our act. Lower harmful outputs. Clean up the oceans. Etc. But co2 itself isnt bad and the heat it is creating isnt bad. Want to talk about bad? Lets talk about global cooling. Everyone keeps thinking in such short spans of time and it changes how they think things should develop. The technological development rush and race just became so crazy that people didnt always think about why we are developing these things or how long it takes and the fact that it comes down to having to rely on the best current systems we have and trying to do our best. But everyone wants something new all the time now. And it leads to so much waste in materials and time. And its just fricken ahsjtbsk.d. orz

Got a source on that?,"[The most credible sounding Source on the first page of Google.](https://www.epa.gov/radtown/radioactive-wastes-coal-fired-power-plants#:~:text=When%20coal%20is%20burned%20to,combustion%20wastes%20are%20fly%20ash.)
Essentially fly ash (waste from coal power plants) has amounts of uranium and thorium inside of it, which due to the nature of being inside ash and therefore airborne spread a lot more radiation than contained, controlled waste from a nuclear power plant."
"while nuclear isn't *safe* its not dangerous either, nor is it very polluting",so what are we going to do with the waste? have it in your basement? what if we have draughts like in france when they had to shut down 80% of their nuclear reactors?
"Idk, the warming climate that is going to destroy millions of lives at the very least, if not completely annihilate humanity...

Also, coal is just plainly stupid to use as of right now. Especially with nuclear power literally RIGHT there.",">Idk, the warming climate that is going to destroy millions of lives at the very least, if not completely annihilate humanity...

That's not a problem..

>Also, coal is just plainly stupid to use as of right now. Especially with nuclear power literally RIGHT there.

Nah, it's not"
"Aigain, I know how China's industry is the biggest Co2 emitter, and by a lot,  
but this meme was about the incoherence of Germany's politicians saying that they do their best for the environment while they actually increased a lot their coal usage. 
But you're right by the fact that saying in the meme ""every country"" was clearly misleading, and I am sorry.","Didn't mean to get on your nerves,    and I don't know how much  fossil fuels Germany is burning,  I don't follow there politics, since my country has become the joke of the world.    On the other hand,  I last heard that Germany is farther along that anyone else in developing a working nuclear fusion reactor, in my opinion is amazing,   it is probably the only answer to getting away from fossil fuels,  since wind and solar are not capable of handling the current power demands, let alone future power demands.     Not counting the pollution that they put out in manufacturing,  and how short the life span is."
Wouldn't it be di-atomic?,Maybe.  English is not my native language
"i mean, thorium is pretty cool, the armour looks fire even for a pre-hardmode ore armor and the weapons aren't half bad",r/unexpectedterraria
I just need is thorium generator and cryofluid to make lots of power,Make sure to get lots of Anti-air nearby or those stupid flares will go and ruin everything
"Still, it can produce a ton of power and is much safer than uranium.",Correct.
But i thought Sam da man was law? What am I gonna do now?,"He is the law, he just slightly exaggerated on Thorium, either way he's right."
They think the steam comes in contact with the uranium. That‚Äôs assuming they know that it‚Äôs steam from the towers and not smoke or something.,The steam nuclear power causes is so clean you could drink it.
"Yeah it‚Äôs water that goes through the condensing pipes that condenses the steam that spins the turbine. That steam that comes out of the stacks is actually two isolated systems removed from the water that actually contacts the uranium.

Uranium heats up water that goes in a pipe and heats up the turbine water to true steam then back to the reactor. the true steam goes and spins a turbine and is cooled by a condensing pipe, the water for the condensing pipe comes from outside the plant and turns to steam out of the stack.",Fake steam taking all the credit.
"Interesting thing about hydropower is the very few see it as a dangerous source of power. Even though it is one of the most dangerous ones due to the risk of dam failure.

Everyone has heard about Chernobyl, which killed a dozen or so directly and possibly (at worst) a few thousand indirectly. But how many had heard about the Banqiao Dam failure of 1975? This killed between 85'600 directly and about 140'000 indirectly as well as destroying at least 5 million homes.","Another side note are places that do run off hydro also fuck up a lot of ecosystems, and the more hydros you run in an area the less those hydros produce."
Nuclear fusion for the win???,"50 years away, for the last 75 years."
"Yea, Im sorry. Even mentioning fracking and nuclear in the same sentence indicates that you either drank the kool aid or are actively trying to spread misinformation.","This isn‚Äôt an argument. It‚Äôs a thinly veiled insult and not a well founded one. 

Every energy source has an environmental impact. Every source has pros and cons. It is valuable to constantly evaluate and reevaluate the pros and the cons to determine the best energy sources for our needs. For example, is wind power worth the trouble when it produces relatively little for the cost to upkeep the turbines?

In regards to fracking, the collection of Natural gas has a high environmental impact, however, you cannot ignore that it‚Äôs one of the most efficient and productive energy sources on the planet. It‚Äôs entirely possible that even though the initial impact of fracking is higher, that it‚Äôs energy efficiency outperforms other sources over the long term. I‚Äôm not actually claiming that, I‚Äôm simply saying it‚Äôs worth consideration."
I was down voted elsewhere a few weeks ago for bringing up that Germany was even using lignite. Worse than coal.,"Hey, to reduce pollution you gotta increase pollution. /s"
"Except it is dangerous and that's why it's so tough finding a spot. Germany thought they were safe, then it turns out water was getting into their waste storage and now the have to move it all.

If it were just that simple then it would have been solved by now. Significantly smarter people than you have been working on it.",Nevada literally refuses to allow it to be buried in a giant rock.
"I'm going by the lifetime cost. Though of course we know nuclear power plants can be run way beyond their planned lifetime, as that is the case with many built in the 70s. The uranium is, as you say, not the major expense.","We will be fucked when coal runs eventually out, we need it for far more thing than uranium or other radioactive elements.

Ofc everything what was mentioned here - the immense pollution from coal power plants or even mining coal itself.

And if we don't have enough reasons to stop making energy from coal, it's also a fact the soil is much less rich on minerals without coal"
"> which reddit has suddenly decided to hate.

Reddit didn't suddenly start hating renewables, it finally recognized the concept of ""base load"" and that without significant advances in battery technology, renewables cannot service that need. We are simply sick of the renewable sycophants who think real life is like a game of SimCity where you can just spam wind turbines down and everything is hunky dory. When these people start talking shit about nuclear, ignorantly, we tend to clap back at them pretty hard, and I suppose you could misconstrue that as ""suddenly deciding to hate renewables"".",Fighting over nuclear vs renewable is like arguing where to eat while papa coal is trying to drive you off a bridge
"Lmao good luck with that. Nobody is hating on renewable, but its not efficient at all, and sacrificing nuclear for them is just fucking dumb.","Why would you say something based solely on an opinion when there is scientific consensus that contradicts it? [something to read]

"None of that contradicts my comment. We didn't build any new ones, just kept using the ones we had.

Turns out you gotta get your power somewhere when your biggest supplier cuts you off.",You also have to get power elsewhere when you shut most of your nuclear reactors because of an earthquake on the other side of the world
"All those countries still build new coal power plants wich is my actual point. 

Edit: except for the US.",As far as I can research America hasn't built a new coal plant since 2013.
Real climate activists know that Nuclear is better for the environment,The environmental movement of the 60s/70s doomed nuclear in the U.S. through ignorant fear mongering. We are where we are due to environmental activists.
"What a stupid decision... Until they can rely 100% on renewable energy, or if we eventually crack contained nuclear fusion, then nuclear fission is by far the safest and most effective energy source...Destroying these nuclear plants would set their goals for fixing climate change back years.",Germany only received 6% of its electricity from nuclear power plants. These 6% will not be covered by coal but from wind energy. In the past they had to shut down the wind turbines because of to much power in the system. The reactors were not able to shut down. So as from now this 6% will be handled by wind. Only in absolut peaks it will be covered by coal. There are so much misinformations around omg. We have not switch nuclear power with coal. And the Party who is crying the louadest had 16 years to mad better politics but NOPE‚Ä¶
So what's the plan..? Buy cheap gas from russians who are committing genocide?,Until our mentally compromised president took office we were exporting more natural gas than Russia. We could easily supply the world with comparatively clean natural gas to provide power until a suitable replacement could be found. A replacement like nuclear.
Thank you this makes more sense than ecolobbies went wild ...,"It‚Äôs pretty annoying to see the reaction from people everywhere‚Ä¶ we had demonstrations in Germany against it, and voices from all over the world that just aren‚Äôt informed sadly‚Ä¶

They didn't shut down nuclear plants and burn coal to compensate?,"No. Coal power production is down since the nuclear exit started. Nuclear was replaced by renewables. Any increase in coal power production was either short term immediately after a shutdown, or due do general increase of energy demand in Germany."
"Isar 2 was the most modern, safe and efficient nuclear powerplant in the world..",So you're telling me they didn't build any new ones at all after 1989?

"Baseload is an outdated concept for fossil and nuclear plants that have hard limits on how flexible their generation can be. A renewable grid doesn't really need to care about planning for periods of low demand. With enough generation, decentralization, and firming, a 100 percent renewable grid is possible.

Meanwhile nuclear 100 percent needs a peaker plant which is usually gas powered. And backup coal plants for when maintenance is needed like France last summer.","Man, even in the worst, France produced 2 Time less CO2/kWh then germany at their best.

And what you say is just absurd, windturbine and solar panel are the worst in consistency and need a back up of gaz or coal (whish is what the german choose)

Its litteraly impossible to have 100% renewable energy in most contry, the only one able to are with hydro, who can stock, but need specific land‚Ä¶

Last but not less important, windturbine are still better then solar panel in most case, and even then, they need 3 time the power needed to be in most case able to produce what is needed.
But you know when we need it the most, yes, on Winter, and what happen in Winter, YES, big wind or no wind, really not much time to produce with windturbine‚Ä¶


Nuclear and renewable should work hand to hand but with a solution to stock the renewable energy, if not, we can‚Äôt trust it.

"No. Coal power production is down since the nuclear exit started. Nuclear was replaced by renewables.

So you're telling me they didn't build any new ones at all after 1989?,"Dont know about the other nations, but in gemrany we didnt. Even if it isnt the most modern(which could very well be) it was the most efficient and safe(in germany). As it never had any problems and was reliably doing its job for 35 years non stop."
"If you can magically summone one of these that would be great, but otherwise, building them is going to take a lot of time and building them in germany is going to take even longer","It is very much worth it as it is much cheaper than what you'd expect, and as I've already said, nuclear reactirs produce a lot of relatively cheap energy"
"But what's about the damage that radiation does to your DNA? Thats often the point where its hard to count deaths and how it really affects people. But yes, newer ones are far more safe.

Btw. mutations are permanent and will be given to future generations too","Okay, so. I believe you have a very, very simple idea of how mutations and dna works judging from the points you made, don't get me wrong I'm not a biologist either, but genetics is one of my top interests. So let me explain, DNA is a code made from a combination of proteins and every living cell in your body cotains DNA. It has the instruction required for a cell to perform mitosis and their tasks. Mutations occur in the human body completely naturally, each day trillions of mutations happen in your body, due to small errors during mitosis. There are some muations that aren't even harmful, as they are one of the many reasons as to why evolution the way it is. And if a mutation is harmful (eg. Cancer cells), in most cases the cell literally deletes itself, and if something goes wrong most times the immune system deals with them. This also happens on a daily basis in the human body. Of course the possibility is there that it gets out of contol and tumors form, but most of the time it doesn't happen. 
So no, not all mutations are permanent.
As for radiation, it only increases the number of mutations, and errors in mitosis, therefore increasing the chances of a tumor. This is pretty unnoticable in modern nuclear powerplants though, as they contain radiation really well, so much so that people living next to a powerplant or people working in them barely recieve anything more than normal background radiation, and isn't noticable. So no contrary to popular belief, living close to a reactor does not increase one's chances to get cancer or permanent dna damage.

If you just take this two numbers you are right, but if you look closer, you find no causality between nuklear energy and coal. In 2020 both droped to a low point, then in 2021 both rised to a higher percentage and in 2022 yes only coal rised, but not because of the ending nuklear energy but because of the embargos to russia that made Gas, which should replace nuklear, much less available, so another energy was needed and you can't just abruply let a nuklear reactor going longer because you dont have the Personal/Uran/security checks needed for this and you whould need time that you dont gave to reinstall all this.

Where do we store spent Solar panels?,in new solar panels. it is called recycling.
"just eat it /s

yeah that is a problem and nuclear isn't a permanent solution but i think establishing them is better than oil/coal plants since renewable can't really do large scale energy production (except hydro but that's obviously limited to water areas)",we could be on 100% renewables right now. simply putting solar panels on the roof of every house would be almost enough for most housholds. then go with wind and hydro to produce excess power et voil√°

Nuclear and renewable should work hand to hand but with a solution to stock the renewable energy, if not, we can‚Äôt trust it.
The best if we could stock is still 50/50 in nuc and renew.",">But you know when we need it the most, yes, on Winter, and what happen in Winter, YES, big wind or no wind, really not much time to produce with windturbine‚Ä¶

I barely took you seriously to begin with and now I know you don't know what you are talking about.

Wind turbines are generally set up at altitudes and in places where wind is constant. Surface level wind you experience is irrelevant, and most are continuous sources of energy. In fact the only time they shutdown is when there is too much wind as a safety precaution. I'm betting you also think solar panels don't work when it's cloudy as well.

And they may have less CO2, but they also have a big waste problem they have no found a permanent solution to.

100 percent renewable is completely feasible and Germany has actually had a decline in coal and gas plants, replacing them with renewables. The idea renewables need nuclear or coal is a lie created by the unscrupulous people who run both industries."
"Sorry, I got that wrong.",No worries!
"Why not replace 6% of coal with wind instead? It's still indirectly keeping coal around longer. I'm fine with phasing out nuclear, but do it after phasing out coal not before

You're thinking of a different reactor. ITER is still being built and is still several years away from being functional. I think you're thinking of EAST, which is tiny compared to ITER. ITER is still definitely a research reactor, but it is projected to be easily energy positive. Once it's online, it's the perfect test bed for that materials research. It's being built with a full remote handling system to easily remove and study all wearing components. That'll make it dead simple to swap in prototype parts too. 

Actual production fusion plants being possible is still a ways off, but probably not as far as most people think. The question is whether they will be financially viable in our lifetime. ITER is a $20 billion project. While a lot of that may be R&D, the facility is still a massive chunk of that cost, and any production plant is going to be roughly the same size or larger. Nuclear is going dirt cheap in comparison for the forseeable future."

Don‚Äôt customers already basically pay for miles by the delivery fee that costs more/less depending on how far the delivery is?,Was about to say they already add like 5 bucks on to every order any more then that I wouldn‚Äôt use it and just drive myself to the restaurant.
"Honestly I don't suggest anyone take up dashing. Had a roommate that did it for spare cash for an entire year, and while it paid for his gas money, after putting about 40k miles on his car in a single year, he eventually broke down and then without a car, he lost both the money from dashing and his regular much better paying job. He had to sign a ridiculous amount for a used car that barely ran to get back on the road. Now the car he has broke down again, but he can't turn the car in without still owing everything he hasn't paid yet and hes worse off than he was before he took up dashing.","Yeah, I've sworn off any gig app (or real job, or that matter) that require me to use my own car.  It's a losing game when you factor in wear and tear and I believe anyone who claims they're making decent money from them are not paying attention to that.  

If you need some money in your pocket *right now* there are worse options but it is not a replacement for a real job."
I stopped using DoorDash awhile ago. The fees seemed to just skyrocket,"I never used it but I heard all the horror stories. 

I‚Äôm glad those were shared so I never used it."
That's an excellent way to convince people to just go out and get it themselves.,I posted this on r/DoorDash and they are trying to roast me üòÜ
Fastest way to lose customers as well lol.,Oh well
Man I tried to sign up for door dash and it said they're full on drivers. But I get a fuckin email every day saying that I should sign up and start earning...,Same üòÇ grub hub too
"Why not make the people who pay you, just, pay you better? Better yet, find a better job? You're barking at the wrong tree here.",I mean I could if I didn't have to live on a crutch so my hip won't go out. I have to do the best I can. Looked for different jobs and all got denied because of it. This is the only job I was accepted in.
Make the customers pay not the company lol,You let me know how to do that
"Lol Yes, the down votes. I know I just called out all the no-tippers.","A bunch of people who expect the service to be free.  Not a single one would use door dash if they couldn't skip the tip and had to pay a premium on the delivery ""to pay a good wage"".  Posers."
"If you can't read it, tap on the picture.","why are they downvoting you, clearly once you tap on the picture the words aren't blurry anymore."
Was about to say they already add like 5 bucks on to every order any more then that I wouldn‚Äôt use it and just drive myself to the restaurant.,More than that. Especially with the heightened menu prices alone
"No, they can take the tips or don't give them tips.",are you saying doordash takes costumers tips and doesn‚Äôt give them to the drivers? Or are you saying costumers don‚Äôt tip when the delivery fee is more expensive?
"Kinda opposite story. My buddy bought a cheap used moped for $800, and a nice rear hanging basket on Amazon and started door dashing. Things been paid for 2 years now and he dashes all the time for extra cash, keeping the miles off his main car. I'd suggest going that route for anyone looking to get into dashing.","Probably smart, mopeds are pretty cheap. Limited range but you won't have as much to worry about in terms of gas and I don't remember if they need Insurance, but probably not much"
I need it for food for my family.,"To be honest, bad work ethics should not be encouraged..."
"I never used it but I heard all the horror stories. 

I‚Äôm glad those were shared so I never used it.",It started out really nice but now. You order 10 dollars of food and where it was 5 in delivery it can easily double the price between their fee and a tip.
"I‚Äôll still use Uber Eats on occasion, but DD is utterly ridiculous 

I‚Äôve put my order into both apps before -same exact store, same exact order - and DD was **$10** more, and it‚Äôs not like there wasn‚Äôt already a mark-up/ extra fees on the Uber Eats one 

I‚Äôm mad about it, tbh. I used to use DD for busy days at the law firm all the time back in 2015. Loved the service. Now they‚Äôre just crooks",Uber eats isn‚Äôt as bad but it‚Äôs also higher than I remember.

You let me know how to do that,"I'm not advocating for this customers to pay

I was pointing out that it's funny that a lot of these people think so lol"
"Especially college kids. Sorry, I absolutely HATE dashing to the college near me. Order after order there's no tip. I'll do one or two and then quit dashing after that. 2.50 a trip isn't worth my time",Well it's so the executives and ceo make money. The drivers get screwed.
are you saying doordash takes costumers tips and doesn‚Äôt give them to the drivers? Or are you saying costumers don‚Äôt tip when the delivery fee is more expensive?,"A lot of times, customers won't tip. The app will give us $2.50 perorder and the rest of the tips will come from the customer. If they choose to tip us. The customer can also tip the money and pull it out after the dasher accepts the order. This has happened to me 6 times, even though I make my deliveries on time."
"Not trying to be mean or anything, but wouldn‚Äôt it be better to just get a different job? Unskilled labor like this was never really meant to pay a sustainable wage.","Thank you for this reply. I have something call Hip dysplasia to wear my leg can pop out of my hip. I can't go on disability, because the state doesn't allow it.

It started out really nice but now. You order 10 dollars of food and where it was 5 in delivery it can easily double the price between their fee and a tip.,I stopped using it once I found out that they also inflate the menu prices as well. Was going to get Lenny's but the prices looked off so compared them with the actual Lenny's app menu and they add like $2 more per sandwich on top of their fees.

https://www.intheknow.com/post/third-grade-teacher-in-austin-texas-gets-reprimanded-for-teaching-students-about-their-legal-and-constitutional-rights-im-concerned-that-they-find-that-concerning/

Even after you read it, you still don‚Äôt really know if she was right. It doesn‚Äôt say what she was teaching about rights. It does suggest she is extremely liberal and political. So if she taught anything more than ‚Äòthese are the bill of rights, etc‚Äô she was rightfully reprimanded.","If you look at what she posted on tik tok, there's another section where they ask the same questions about Harry Potter. The way the questions are asked, it's not saying she can't teach them about rights, it's saying how does this fit in with your expected lesson plan.

Based on her absolutely smarmy tik tok presence, I suspect she's deviating from what is expected to be taught and the principal is asking her to justify why it's being taught within the lesson plan.

This is completely reasonable of course, but she'll frame it whatever way she wants because she's it's apparent based on her posts she's attempting to be a tiktok influencer."

Apparently you don't understand that Austin has become a progressive/ hipster hellhole. If a teacher was reprimanded then it was because they didn't toe the left-wing line.,"Do you live here? Have you gone to school here? It's *normal*. I've had an ancap friend who pretty much went to school every day in a suit. Another girl had a copy of the constitution in her pocket at all times, and we used to have fun debates in both english and social studies classes. It's not a leftist indoctrination center unless being you believe learning about evolution in 9th grade bio is cultural marxism.

If you bothered to read the [article](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/third-grade-teacher-austin-texas-190458485.html), the teacher is progressive and absolutely not on your side. Judging from the administrator's letter, she was teaching them about freedom of speech, protest, and the ability to remain seated (presumably during something like the morning pledge).

To be fair, this is probably overblown; the admins are probably making sure the teacher isn't attaching her own personal beliefs to the lessons, and making sure that each student individually has their own reasons to practice such speech.

But it does go to show how skeptical the Austin education establishment is about freedom of speech and breaking from the (*conservative*) norm. Judging from the comments, apparently a bunch of other (*progressive*) Texas teachers quit due to similar treatment."

If you bothered to read the [article](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/third-grade-teacher-austin-texas-190458485.html), the teacher is progressive and absolutely not on your side. Judging from the administrator's letter, she was teaching them about freedom of speech, protest, and the ability to remain seated (presumably during something like the morning pledge).

To be fair, this is probably overblown; the admins are probably making sure the teacher isn't attaching her own personal beliefs to the lessons, and making sure that each student individually has their own reasons to practice such speech.

But it does go to show how skeptical the Austin education establishment is about freedom of speech and breaking from the (*conservative*) norm.

Keep in mind that propoganda just means something that is intended to persuade an audience to a particular point of view - it doesn't necesarily mean ""evil"" or even ""wrong"" - it just means that it's something biased that is intended to push an agenda.

Are you familiar with the history of the pledge of allegiance? The original version was literally authored by A Union Army officer who **wrote books about how to teach patriotism in schools**.

It **is** propaganda - whether you personally believe that it is good propaganda or bad propaganda is a personal choice.

"It isn't a public school's place to debate social and political issues.

For instance, what if a state education board decided to teach *against* lgbtq rights, instead of just not allowing the discussion at all?

If states codify teaching lgbtq rights, opposing states will codify teaching anti-lgbtq rights. It opens the door to this. That's why it's much more preferable to just leave schools out of it, and teach your children about social and political issues yourself.

Right?

No. When people like you say ""common sense gun laws"" my normal response is to ask ""like what?"" and in response I receive either vague concepts that are already on the books in many places (like background checks, waiting periods, etc.) or ideas that won't actually do anything to stop gun violence (like assault weapons bans).

Combined with the fact that many gun control laws DO get used to try to de facto ban guns, I really don't trust you. So, I will ask you a simple question.

Would you support a law that banned all personal ownership of firearms? Why or why not?"
"I‚Äôm not regurgitating Fox News, everything‚Äôs not that easy. Corporate lobbyists benefit from overpolicing and building private prisons in gerrymandered voting districts and scary tabloid fear mongering. That‚Äôs why they love republicans.

It‚Äôs bipartisan.",So who‚Äôs trying to take your guns away? Got any names and specific actions?
Do you really think that private gun ownership would do anything at all if the fucking US military decided they wanted to come by door to door and kill every one of us? Guns aren‚Äôt saving us against the strongest military in the world,"1.4 million members of the US military vs 50-60 million reported gun owners in the US.

Not every member of the military will be OK with killing the populace, in fact most won't.  You'll probably lose a good chunk of the military if it was attempted.  Also, we can probably assume that 10-20% of gun owners don't report their gun ownership.

Even if every member of the military did participate in your scenario, all it takes is each household killing 1 member of the military during their murder campaign, and the campaign will very quickly be over.

The military could try and use things like jets and tanks and bombs, but my guess is that the collateral damage to non gun owners would be so great that these tools would quickly be abandoned in lieu of door to door gun grabs.  Then the door to door gun grabs would quickly be over through attrition via sheer numbers.

So yes, guns are very much able to save us from the strongest military in the world."

"Of course, it's not your rights that are up for grabs.",How would you even know that?
"1.4 million members of the US military vs 50-60 million reported gun owners in the US.

Not every member of the military will be OK with killing the populace, in fact most won't.  You'll probably lose a good chunk of the military if it was attempted.  Also, we can probably assume that 10-20% of gun owners don't report their gun ownership.

Even if every member of the military did participate in your scenario, all it takes is each household killing 1 member of the military during their murder campaign, and the campaign will very quickly be over.

The military could try and use things like jets and tanks and bombs, but my guess is that the collateral damage to non gun owners would be so great that these tools would quickly be abandoned in lieu of door to door gun grabs.  Then the door to door gun grabs would quickly be over through attrition via sheer numbers.

So yes, guns are very much able to save us from the strongest military in the world.","I disagree with a lot of this, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre dumb. We may just disagree.

Re: military members not following orders, I think you overestimate how many people would be deflecting. We already kill innocent people all over the globe and our militarized police have no problem killing innocent US citizens during peaceful protests. I don‚Äôt think the magnitude of military members defying orders out of the goodness of their heart would be very large.

If the government truly wanted to come after us, I think they would absolutely be wiping cities off the face of the map, not just going after gun owners individually and trying to reduce collateral damage. Again, we‚Äôve done that all over the world.

Overall, my point is that if the US government decided it would be beneficial to them and their goals, they could easily kill any citizen they wanted to and armed civilians (which are only 30% of Americans) won‚Äôt make an impact on their tanks, military-grade guns, striker drones, bombs, etc. Its not going to be 1:1 shootouts, it would be them flattening any and all dissidents with ease.

The pro-gun argument of ‚Äúwe need private gun ownership so we can defend ourselves against the government‚Äù became outdated decades ago, in my opinion. No one can beat the US military (unfortunately - I think this is a huge issue in and of itself).

One additional piece of evidence that the government would easily destroy us is the fact that we have a fully militarized police force. There are tanks, military weapons, etc. in the hands of local police - in NYC, where I live, our police budget is equal to the entire military budget of Vietnam. They probably wouldn‚Äôt even need to call in the national guard.

To be clear, I am personally anti-gun for many reasons, but I can understand some pro-gun arguments, ex. wanting protection for your home in the event of an intruder. I just don‚Äôt think this particular argument makes sense in a modern context."

I did this but cannot login into my YouTube account. So I miss my channel subscriptions and get random recommendations. Do you know how to fix this?,Just subscribe to all the channels you like on this app by searching for them.
Free youtube premium with even more features like SponsorBlock and ReturnYoutubeDislike built in.,"Well fuck, RIP"
Youtube now flags accounts that used it.,Then update it so it doesn't anymore
Free youtube premium with even more features like SponsorBlock and ReturnYoutubeDislike built in.,Ohhh damn
Is it good? I deleted my YouTube Vanced and download NewPipe.,"Yes, I use it"
"Sorry, but does revanced require root? Just asking for myself and other people who may stumble upon your comment.","No, it doesn't, but you need to download the youtube apk directly (as a file, not just by installing it from playstore), and then you install the revanced manager, from where you can modify that apk to include some patches, things that remove ads, add sponsorblock or update the logo. You can even selectively pick which patches you want, and which you don't.

The reason they do this is that it bypasses the legal issue of them distributing a modified version directly, as that contains YouTube's copyrighted material which they're not allowed to modify. By making the users modify the APK themselves, they only develop these patches, which are perfectly legal, and it's pretty much impossible for YouTube to go after individuals, they won't sue a million people from various different countries, it's not worth it to them, at all."
Trie revanced extended,"Infinite video buffering issues after watching around a minute of it. Closing it and reopening it works, but only for another minute."
Have you installed microG as well,"i have vanced microG, where do i get revanced one?"
"New pipe is a good alternative, especially if you hate shitty recommendations, ads, and short form content. Only catch is you can't use your account or comment but that's not necessarily a bad thing.",The solution to your problem is MicroG
and dont reset your youtube password,and do not the cat
There is a workaround. Uninstall the app and download the hotfix via GitHub. Install as standalone.,What's the Link you used? I'm not familiar with github.
Bold of you to assume it's an iphone,apple doesn't allow any modified apps like vanced (free without ads) so its usually apple users who don't know what it even is
Not a problem anymore since I life in the EU,What difference does that make? Stopped working here too.
Then update it so it doesn't anymore,I installed the standalone apk from the github. It's made with ReVanced patches. It no longer gets any updates officially.
"Yes, I use it","If i watch videos on revanced it just plays a minute or so and then it loads endlessly, did you have the same issue?"
"Infinite video buffering issues after watching around a minute of it. Closing it and reopening it works, but only for another minute.","Yh i've the same problem from what i've hear it's google blocking your account because you've been ""spoted"" while using a custom youtube client you have to log in to another account and it should work, for me it does."
"i have vanced microG, where do i get revanced one?",[deleted]
The solution to your problem is MicroG,My problem? I like new pipe it gets rid of youtube shorts
and do not the cat,"oh god, oh fuck, i- i, i did the cat, what do I do now??? it‚Äôs going fucking crazy and summoning satan please help"
What's the Link you used? I'm not familiar with github.,https://github.com/cuynu/ytvanced/releases/tag/18.02.33
apple doesn't allow any modified apps like vanced (free without ads) so its usually apple users who don't know what it even is,But it did exist for IOS so‚Ä¶ checkmate!
What difference does that make? Stopped working here too.,Apple is forced to allow other App Stores in EU phones
"If i watch videos on revanced it just plays a minute or so and then it loads endlessly, did you have the same issue?",Try going into.  Revanced settings -> miscellaneous -> enable protobuf spoof.  Then restart app.  Has worked for me
"Yh i've the same problem from what i've hear it's google blocking your account because you've been ""spoted"" while using a custom youtube client you have to log in to another account and it should work, for me it does.",damn that sucks.
"same issue here, its more enjoyable to watch a milion ads than reopen every min","yup. I'm trying to troubleshoot this, because I have no idea of why this happens; it didn't happen until fairly recently."
[deleted],"That's completely false, for legal reasons there's no official Revanced Apk. If you want to get the official revanced, you have to get the revanced patcher form their github, then patch a youtube apk with it. To prevent video buffering, use the spoof signature verification."
My problem? I like new pipe it gets rid of youtube shorts,MicroG allows you to use Google account in ReVanced
"oh god, oh fuck, i- i, i did the cat, what do I do now??? it‚Äôs going fucking crazy and summoning satan please help",you fucked the cat?
Try going into.  Revanced settings -> miscellaneous -> enable protobuf spoof.  Then restart app.  Has worked for me,That setting isn't showing up for me
damn that sucks.,"I'm not sure if you heard this, but in the patcher, you must enable spoof-signature-verification to fix the infinite loading problem."
MicroG allows you to use Google account in ReVanced,"Yeah, but It's the youtube shorts and recommendations i hate, and Vanced still has those."
That setting isn't showing up for me,"Did you patch the YouTube APK using revanced manager? If you want to take a risk you can try downloading revanced extended apk, I did that because I couldn't patch it and found the setting in that app.  Has worked for me"
"I'm not sure if you heard this, but in the patcher, you must enable spoof-signature-verification to fix the infinite loading problem.","oh wow, that helps a lot. Ty for that."
"Did you patch the YouTube APK using revanced manager? If you want to take a risk you can try downloading revanced extended apk, I did that because I couldn't patch it and found the setting in that app.  Has worked for me","I went ahead and downloaded ReVanced Extended, and found it just fine, thanks"
Hahaha! This is totally what 1999 was like!,But the millennium was a year after that cause there was no year 0
"I was around in 1999, and this triggered some long-suppressed memories. Curse you.","The who ""see you next year"" trope went into hyperdrive that year, I still have flashbacks!"

"Except renewable energy sources require maintenance far more often.

You also need far *more* of them to provide the same power as a single nuclear station.

For example, the largest solar power station in the world is in India. That solar power plant produces, on a good day, less than half the power a single nuclear reactor produces despite covering over 300 square kilometers.

A single nuclear power plant with 4-6 reactors would cover less than a tenth of that space, and provide far, far more power.","Yeah true that you need a lot more, but you sure that an nuclear plant wich needs surveillance and maintenance basically all day (I knew an nuclear plant technician and they needed to constantly check and fiddle with stuff to hold it up to the high standards) is not more expensive,like long term.And the nuclear rods and such?

but I‚Äôm not against nuclear plants tbh I would support it if we could maybe get one or two with the newest technology that would be also a lot more risk free and more of the rods themselves can be used."
"Small decreases in supply can cause massive increases in price if demand stays the same. Because people panic when prices rise. So often people will choose to try to collect more electricity than they need because they worry about future price. 

That's why we ran out of toilet paper in so many places a couple of years ago. There was a decrease in supply but there was still enough to match demand. But people panic so they buy more than they need and that increases the price.","Also if there is a shortage of power, jacking up the prices will cause a lot of people to cut back on their usage, which prevents overloading the grid. 

It‚Äôs why the US often has ‚Äòpeak rate hours‚Äô where electricity is more expensive, it encourages people to move their energy consumption to the off-peak hours, which stabilizes the load on the grid."
 less energy + same request = higher prices,"only in part. In the EU the Energy price is made by the most expensive power plant.
Example:
You need 100Kw 
From these 100 Kw are 
50Kw from renewable energy, (10c per Kw)
40 Kw from Coal and (30c per Kw)
10 Kw from Gas(50c per Kw)

So in this example is your Energy price at 50c per Kw.

Nuclear fuel rods as well are rapidly becoming a non-issue as well, with the advent of hybrid and breeder reactors which can re-use rods until they are effectively inert.

A lot of people have got their mindset regarding nuclear stuck in the 60's, thinking the technology hasnt advanced in the last 60+ years. The technology had advanced, significantly so.

Nuclear reactors are smaller (and more powerful) than ever, the latest gen reactors and containment units require five times less material to construct than the previous generation reactors despite being massively more powerful.

Newer technologies are also dealing with the handful of downsides of nuclear which arent much of an issue anyway any longer as modern reactors produce such a small amount of waste its barely worth thinking about."

Edit: i Misunderstood the word ""not at all' i meant: only in part","Well in a certain way both of you are right. While you are right on how the price is calculated you are wrong with the assumption that these are fixed prices for the different types of power plants. So if you have 5 different gas power plants for example they most likely produce all for different prices because the efficiency varies always depending how they were build, weather conditions and way more stuff. In the end you will end up with probably a price range of somewhere between 40-60c per kW for example. In this case cutting out cheaper methods will definitely result in a higher price for the whole market since now the 55c-60c powerplants are the one dictating the price instead of the 50c ones. Even thought this sounds maybe strange but we got enough power plants that until this day run nearly never since they were not cost efficient but will run now since they actually dictate the market and finally make the cut. So in the end prices will go up and even way worse when they cut off coal because then the most inefficient other powerplants gonna be the new price dictators leading in bad times of sun and wind to insane pricing or the need to buy nuclear power from other countries. In all honesty this price calculation system ist totally broken/stupid and it needs some corrections especially because it is nothing else than a money printing machine for solar and wind park owner on the back of the people needing to pay the price of the price dictator no matter what. An average price would be a good solution."

unless you live in an area where you can walk/bike/ transit(depends on quality)  to work.,How does that changing anything? You're still spending energy and time traveling to a place you have no desire or reason to go to other than your employment agreement. That's time and energy that could be better spent on your own life. You should be compensated appropriately.
Long commutes to work are actually subsidies paid directly to the landlords of neighbours of people who are not your neighbours.,"I am dumb, what?"
"In the USA, commuting expenses can be written off your federal income taxes (with some caveats) if you aren't otherwise compensated for them. So, yeah, it is work.

Edit: having been self-employed for so long, i apparently got that a little wrong. i'm not a tax professional. i apologize. My comment was also only intended to address the original context of it being considered work. And, in that regard, the government doesn't technically consider it work usually, but that doesn't mean it isn't from a practical standpoint.
Deductible mileage only applies if a person is self-employed. This includes ride-share drivers, Lyft or Uber drivers, etc., although ride-share mileage to the first pick up isn't deductible. There are some other cases where mileage or expenses may be deductible, but i'm not going to get into all that, since it's not an area of personal expertise.","commuting to and from your home to office is not a tax write off. Having to travel while on the job (for instance, from one office to another office) is."
And employer's are legally required to give you travel expenses compensation.,"Only if on the job, say they send you to a conference or class."

How does that changing anything? You're still spending energy and time traveling to a place you have no desire or reason to go to other than your employment agreement. That's time and energy that could be better spent on your own life. You should be compensated appropriately.,With that logic you also need to be compensated to stay fit so you can keep doing your job.

Also, yes, r/fuckcars.","Except for one time, I have never worked in a city I would want to live in."

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

It is not a straightforward task to calculate how many liters of semen of a particular viscosity could fill the Grand Canyon, as the volume of the canyon is much larger than any realistic estimate of the total amount of semen produced by the human male population. However, for the sake of a rough calculation, let's assume the average volume of semen produced by a human male is around 5 milliliters (0.005 liters).

"That's only if it applies retroactively. If not, what jerry did was wish away the Djinn's power for no reason other than shits and giggles.","It kinda goes round, doesn't it? The Djinn is not being able to grant the wish (f you Jerry), but it wouldn't be able to grant it firta time (?)

"I'm honestly feel like I should be shocked there is no consumers boycott by now...

"My adblock: No, fuck YOU!","Uno reverse card. 
Your move YouTube."
"Ok then, let me introduce you to uBlock Origin and YouTube Revanced.",Does revanced allow creators to obtain the same revenue flow? First I‚Äôve heard of it and not sure how the whole Adsense payout thing works
"""Buy YouTube Premium!""

Huawei Store publishing it for free:üóø","Wait, they do?"
"Me on my phone watching stuff:

Youtube: have 20 seconds of unskip able ad

Me showering as yt plays in background:

YouTube: perfect, have 20 minutes of a skip able ad, good luck doing that","just use adbloxk on your phone! I dont use the youtube app for years now, just use firefox nightly, there are all addons available that you have on pc."
"If the product is free, you're the product.",This.
"I'm ok with ads. They're a necessary evil. But YouTube ads these days are insane. 
It's like YT is an ad player more than a Social Media/Video platform.",I was just wanting to watch a 3 sec video and i got 2 unskippable 15 second ads
"Pc: Brave + Sponsorblock
Mobile : vanced YT","Don't use Brave, use Firefox with uBlock Origin with sponsorblock and return youtube dislikes. While for mobile (Android) just use revanced."
i dont hink i have ever seen any ad on youtube... hy would you not just use an adblock ?,Phones exist. I use Revanced now tho
To be fair. It's a free service. If you pay you'll enjoy their service without ads.,"I could enjoy it before without 2 unskippable ads ever 2 mins and they were still making tons of money.

Not its just waaaaaaay ott."
Friendly reminder that *the channel* chooses how much and what type of adds they want on their videos.,"If the owner doesn‚Äôt put adds on the video, YouTube does it for them, there‚Äôs no way around it (unfortunately)"
Have you been on Twitch lately? Try 5 x 30 second ads. No skip.,"I don‚Äôt use Twitch very often, but the streamer I watch the most is really nice about that. She gets some sort of indication when ads are about to play, and mentions it to the viewers. Then she makes sure not to do anything interesting until she hears from people in chat that the ads are done. Makes for a useful bathroom break time in what‚Äôs usually a 3 hour stream."
Might i ask what is the best ad blocker for mobile.,Opera? Has a built in adblock
Does revanced allow creators to obtain the same revenue flow? First I‚Äôve heard of it and not sure how the whole Adsense payout thing works,Unfortunately no
"Wait, they do?",Yes
Everyone's scared of Chinese tech spying on them... But they do got that free premium tho,"The NSA already won the Race to your info so why not the Chinese too?

Personally i don't care because i don't have anything on my phone except Call Of Duty, memes and Breaking Bad, Nothing worth spying. I just let the NSA agent have fun with the Memes i have"

"I could enjoy it before without 2 unskippable ads ever 2 mins and they were still making tons of money.

Not its just waaaaaaay ott.","Personally, them covering up the dislike bar was much much worse than ads, which you could at least wait or do something else..."
Opera? Has a built in adblock,Ok thanks
"Not Opera, Brave Browser.

Almost the same as Chrome, but literally 0 ads, unless you leave recommended ones on, so you get money for it.",Finally found another brave user
"Opera is good for mobile but then you're watching YouTube in a browser which depending on your phone isn't always the nicest experience. If you have an apple product you're shit out of luck but if you have an android then you have a few options. Youtube ReVanced is an app that you can find the apk file for online (ONLY use their official website, I think it links to github) and it works pretty well, it's got sponsorblock and adblock built in. However youtube is aware of apps like it so every now and then they update the site in ways the break those apps which is why people are using ReVanced instead of youtube vanced.

ReVanced is mostly still working for me so it's what I use but the other option for a dedicated app might be newpipe. It doesn't allow you to log into youtube unfortunately but it does let you retrieve your subs so it's not all bad.","Ok,  thanks for the help üòä"
"Firefox with the ""ublock origin"" addon also works well. You can even put videos on in the background with another addon.",Thanks for helping me!
"If for YouTube i would suggest downloading YouTube revanced.
Features. No ads, even removing sponsors from within YouTube videos , videos will play when minimized and some other stuff",Thanks for the help!!!
Unfortunately no,"Yeah, that is unfortunate. YouTube is shooting themselves in the foot."
"Of course not. The advertisers pay people to see the ads. If you don't see the ads, the creator doesn't get paid. Unless the developer of Revanced is willing to pay millions of dollars.","they porbably meant to ssk if it doesn something like make youtube ""belive"" you actually watched the ad, hence giving revenue to the creators"
Yes,link?
"The NSA already won the Race to your info so why not the Chinese too?

"Personally, them covering up the dislike bar was much much worse than ads, which you could at least wait or do something else...",There is a dislike plugin
Finally found another brave user,Mood brother?
"Didn‚Äôt know how it worked. Thanks, look into it further when I can","A lot if not most people use them. That's why ad money is worth basically nothing these days and everyone has a sponsor and a Patreon. If you give the creator a couple bucks a month, that's way more than they'd ear just from your views."
link?,CCP gives you 20 social credit
"Legit. What do I have of great value that our own government isn't already privy to? The most boring people seem to care the most about ""teh guvment tak'n mah day-tah!""","The sense of ""not having privacy"" is what worries these people even though they publish every private thing about them on Social Media.

It's also the thought of someone reading your conversations.

It seems bad at first but if you think it through you go ""whatever"" because you just don't have anything important"
There is a dislike plugin,Which doesn't mean that YouTube wasn't in the wrong to remove the functionality of the button. The extension only works if everyone downloads it.
Which doesn't mean that YouTube wasn't in the wrong to remove the functionality of the button. The extension only works if everyone downloads it.,"They were wrong i agree with you

"They were wrong i agree with you

"Stampy was one of the first minecraft youtubers ever. He has done over 800 episodes of 30 minute ""my lovely world"" minecraft videos, all the while doing probably hundreds of other series' and being on TV and one of the main starts of Minecon 2015. Family friendly content for years",sounds nice. why is it ending?
WHY THE FUCK IS THIS GETTING DOWNVOTED,"Because they're taking something Intended to be a joke about how women are often portrayed as overly emotional, and men as overly stoic, and making it a sexism thing.

It's already satire, and they made a satire, about a satire, that missed the original satire."
Stampy is a popular Minecraft YouTuber whose lovely World Series has been running for a decade,"Thank you

So he finished working on the series? What does he do now?"
Thank you other random internet person,"   Dear, 1st Random Internet person

You‚Äôre welcome.

  Love, 3rd Random Internet Person"
"Your welcome kind sir, and good day to you",Good day to you too sir
sounds nice. why is it ending?,"Man probably just wants to move on, he's been doing this particular series for 11 years now, plus coming up with new ideas can be tough. I hope he still continues with a more relaxed schedule or something, or more collabs with the people he used to like iballisticsquid, AshDubh (would be hard) AmyLee33, etc"
Good day to you too sir,And a good day to you as well sir

I'm lonely cuz nobody cares about my existence,"We care, nice cock bro"
Spending my life playing video games and being on reddit is far more important than having a wife and kids. Its not a phase mom and dad. This is a LIFE STYLE,Just make sure you live stably enough to keep those video games dry and protected from UV damage and have enough internets to reddit. And their you go sustainable lifestyle.
"It's already too expensive to live, adding dating on top of that is too much for many","But‚Ä¶if you go halfsies then you have cheaper rent, food, and utilities. It all evens itself out if you‚Äôre both chipping in adequately."
"I gave up dating once I realized that no one in my country shares my interests in video games, memes, and politics, and also I don't give a shit about their interests either.",Not even dating. But I felt the same way and felt I needed some friends. So I joined online communities with similar interests like official discord server for the game I've been playing for a long time. And it's working ok for me.
"Why is a mirrored ""ass"" and ""jerk"" on their faces?","It's from the anime ""your name"", where the characters swap bodies (at least in the beginning) until they suddenly stop and they spend years trying to find each other. While they're swapping, they set each other up in situations (mitsuha gets Taki a date with someone) and they communicate with each other by leaving notes, either on their phones or by drawing on their hands or in this case, their faces. Great movie btw"
I am single because I am an asshole.,Based
"Nah, school is more important than women.",Agreed.
I‚Äôm gonna need more motivation than society saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do‚Äù for me to start dating. Waste of time imo,"Hey, you do you."
"I can't have sex. So I don't pursue relationships. 

I could fix that. 

Instead, I've decided to wait for a reason to.","I mean you do you, but you dont NEED sex in a relationship and if someone really is into they may be okay with that.

Like I said its your life, but I think too many people put too high of importance towards sex in a relationship."
The movie this template is from is great,What's it called
"I'm 27. Never have kissed, dated, drank alcohol, zero friends, etc. Zero friends And I think I maybe wont date but want to now. What do I do? And why am I commenting this?",Cheer up! It's a lot better than the opposite. You can start with a clean sheet whenever it comes your way. Just don't force anything.
Sauce?,"Anime Movie: ""Your Name""

It's a great movie"
Old people who are married die or have a divorce and the new gen is too young rn gen z is still mostly children. Oh and internet propaganda to,Internet propaganda?
"The reason people in many countries than just our own are single is because there's like 3 boys to every 1 girl and the girls that are around are being EASILY brainwashed into thinking they're the opposite gender, those who do that make the boys not want them, they think they're gay when they are not, they think men have to earn 6 figures, I've met one person who earned six figures maybe two in my whole life, Dad and my brother Shane. Last reason is the women right now are fucking just RUDE and I don't know why, compliment them? Rude. Have a slightly different opinion based on facts? Rude. Don't like their bad attitude? Rude.","I think the girls being rude is about social status. As soon as they think you're important they play nice, but if they think you're a nobody they look at you like gum on their shoe"
"Answer: govt funded dating. Literally helps provide for you an SO. It's gotta be a good program too.

And no, dating apps don't count.",Government mandated dating. Almost as good as government mandated happiness I enforce upon my city in frost punk.
It is nice being able to buy what I want whenever though,It better when you have someone buy you gift and not spend anything
"Dating is awful these days. There‚Äôs no loyalty, trust or respect and everyone is completely obsessed with themselves.

Honestly dudes need to do a lot better. One look at most women‚Äôs texts or social media messages and you‚Äôll realize why they think guys are all pervy creeps. A lot of you straight up are that. Just FYI, no girl ever went from not noticing you to head over heels because you sent an unsolicited picture of your dick. They are just laughing at you with their friends.",Let‚Äôs not act as if it‚Äôs just men that are problematic. We also have the absolute horrible asshat women out there
Solves overpopulation tbh,Nah. Population has to be maintained. Minimum birth rate should be equal to death rate. Otherwise we will have to deal with an aging population resulting in major stress on the economy. On an individual level that means you can say goodbye to your retirement as there won‚Äôt be any younger generations to pay for your retirement.
"We care, nice cock bro",Can you compliment my cock?
Nice cock dude,"No you

Just make sure you live stably enough to keep those video games dry and protected from UV damage and have enough internets to reddit. And their you go sustainable lifestyle.,No UV damage if I never open the windows
"But‚Ä¶if you go halfsies then you have cheaper rent, food, and utilities. It all evens itself out if you‚Äôre both chipping in adequately.","Shacking up is probably the biggest thing you can do to cut costs. Plus, you don't have to date expensively anymore - once you share a bank account and realize how poor you are, a big night out is a trip to the pub to get nachos."
Not even dating. But I felt the same way and felt I needed some friends. So I joined online communities with similar interests like official discord server for the game I've been playing for a long time. And it's working ok for me.,"Hey, it might just work out eventually. I know a guy who lives out in California, met a gal through War Thunder of all games. I don‚Äôt usually date anyone, I just go out and work on hobbies, talk to new people‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll work out eventually. You‚Äôll find someone, if they don‚Äôt find you."

"I mean you do you, but you dont NEED sex in a relationship and if someone really is into they may be okay with that.

What's it called,‚ÄòYour name‚Äô
"Anime Movie: ""Your Name""

It's a great movie",Thanks my guy it lookes intresting
Internet propaganda?,Well it's possible that people who are constantly getting exposed to communities like feminism or sigma get the wrong idea about said community and start to hate on the other gender. It's all about analysing the community in the correct way but if a person is incapable of that it will lead to problems further in their lives
"I think the girls being rude is about social status. As soon as they think you're important they play nice, but if they think you're a nobody they look at you like gum on their shoe",Most people are a nobody. Which is why there's ZERO excuse for it
It better when you have someone buy you gift and not spend anything,Don‚Äôt need a partner for that. Strong friendships already solve that issue
Can you compliment my cock?,That there is one good lookin‚Äô cock bro!
"No you

"Shacking up is probably the biggest thing you can do to cut costs. Plus, you don't have to date expensively anymore - once you share a bank account and realize how poor you are, a big night out is a trip to the pub to get nachos.",The nachos part sounds nice
Lol they still want you to pay for everything and if you don't they go after your livelihood.. NGL IMHO absolutely not...,I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôve had experiences like that. There are good partners out there and I‚Äôve been lucky enough to be with one that hasn‚Äôt caused those problems. You just gotta hold each other accountable or get a prenup if you‚Äôre planning on getting married.
Sounds cute,Better love story than Twilight.

Better love story than Twilight.,Anything is

Anything is,"Nah but jokes apart it's a great movie 10/10.

Watch it if you've got the time."
Like a friendgroup?,You don‚Äôt even have to be friends to have a partner sometimes y‚Äôall paired cause of work or to solve common issues or because y‚Äôall want to be friends idk loneliness is a problem because people keep themselves that way and never bother to partner with anyone
Well why did you crash it?,"Im going to be honest i was speeding a little (but it was under the legal speed limit) and when i saw a car i hit the breaks, but what i didn't know is that my breaks took a day off work and boom crashed face to face with another car"
"Im going to be honest i was speeding a little (but it was under the legal speed limit) and when i saw a car i hit the breaks, but what i didn't know is that my breaks took a day off work and boom crashed face to face with another car",Ngl it's pretty weird that you were scared of crashing the car and still decided to drive over the speed limit

His products got removed cause he‚Äôs a conspiracy theorist with tons of libel cases and is a brand risk, and I‚Äôm pretty sure BB&B sales were already on the downward trend.

talk to advertisers not fast food workers,"As someone who has done product photography, that top burger ain't real"
"The picture vs reality thing for food should be classed as false advertising. You are definitely not getting what you asked for.

P.S. i am aware that the pictures and tricks used to get the final shot would make the food inedible, which kind of proves my point.

I wouldn't blame the fast food workers though as there is absolutely no chance in hell they could ever make it look like the picture with the ingredients they have.","From a legal perspective there is an exception for embellishment in advertising, called ""puffing.""

The thing that makes me laugh is the bad looking burger is the only edible one. The way they shoot those burgers for the ad is fascinating. They use like metal and glue and toothpicks and rubber. Its pretty interesting.,"Also, you know the ""grillmarks""? They are probably made with a heated up metal rod to make it look like it was really on a grill."

Why are you blaming the workers?,[deleted]

"Every advertiser on Earth, can you explain this?",The top one is not likely food at all‚Äîfood stylists use a variety of different materials (eg. Wax etc). It‚Äôs rarely up to the marketer about how the food should look. The client dictates that sort of thing. The client being Burger King.
Ice cream in ads is mashed potatoes,The fizz in soda is Alka seltzer.
"Unpopular opinion: I don't a crap about the looks, as long as it tastes good",True. But the top one looks like it tastes better. Plus has more stuff in it. Still agree though.
How sloppy can joe be?,sloppier
I dont think people realize how much speed is prioritized in fast food. A great example is another misunderstanding with fast food: People often wonder why their order is wrong or messed up and dont realize the way these systems are set up is to just get it out the door asap. They'd rather just get it out the door and deal with the few people who actually complain or correct it than to get it right the first time.,"people forgot what ‚Äúfast food‚Äù is all about, it‚Äôs not get it out of the door in 30 seconds flat it‚Äôs about making the food and not having people sit down to eat it for 13 minutes and then leave, they want people to eat it anywhere but not where they are (yet they still have seats available) but i guess the 30 seconds flat thing is still entitled to fast food"
Psssttt.... It's because no food imagery is made with real food. Most of it is molded clay or other items,And if it's not it's severely edited and also took hours to make it look good
It wouldn't be called food anymore,It wouldn‚Äôt be called anymore.
You would sit at a diner or restaurant instead.,"Ever watch Demolition man? lol, Only restaurant that survived the downfall of bad economy etc was Taco bell and it was a formal sit down restaurant. Pretty hard to imagine that... lol"
It‚Äôs not fast anymore anywhere.,"Bring back classic mcdonald's where everyone gets the same burger and fries, but it takes 15 seconds to make."
It's no longer fast food anyway. McD's take longer then most restaurants.,Same with Burger King sometimes. Only fast food that's actually fast is Subway.
Why would they shoot the ads? Are they putting it out of its misery?,It‚Äôs an American ad
Right?! Like that sandwich on the bottom probably tastes amazing even though it looks much worse,"No, like they actually use glue-based liquids and fake foods to make it look the way that they do for ads. There's an entire video on YouTube about how they do it if you're interested in the know-how."
"As someone who has done product photography, that top burger ain't real",Then why make an unrealistic standard?  Why not put the real burger in the photo so it more closely resembles the product we are getting?

I'm sure there was a specific time corporate wanted us to achieve but during a rush it's like being in a submarine that just got hit. Everyone is encouraged (barked at) to just keep the line moving.

I have been to some that have been pretty good. The quality really depends on the location though. There is a whataburger not far from my house that is always garbage. Yet I know of another location about 30 min away that has always been really good, and worth the drive."
Then why make an unrealistic standard?  Why not put the real burger in the photo so it more closely resembles the product we are getting?,"Because it looks appetising, the other one looks like a dog shit sandwich. Which one do you think customers would prefer to buy?"

"Don't they use wood varnish on the meat, I know the heads on beer & bubbles in coffee are usually dish soap

Like just make a fake out of non edible materials instead of ruining food","Usually we are legally required to start with the actual food product.  When you work in commercials you also end up doing so many wildly different things that creating a more permanent prop would probably not make sense. And even if you did only shoot burgers there is no way McDonald‚Äôs and A&W would be ok with having the same fake lettuce or cheese on their burger.

Aside from things looking better things like the fake head in bear and varnish on a burger are also just logistic necessities. You could have the best looking Michelin star burger on earth, but you out that under a hot light and wait a couple hours and it will look like crap. Food for camera has to be partly fake just to avoid it melting/going flat/wilting."
"Because it looks appetising, the other one looks like a dog shit sandwich. Which one do you think customers would prefer to buy?",Well at this point it's just false advertising either make the photo look like dog shit an lose customers or make the product look halfway decent instead of lying to customers üôÑ
All advertising is an unrealistic standard,Some of it is more realistic then others
Money.  They want people in the store.,They'll get more people in the store I'd their products actually looked like the advertisements
because they want to sell you the product,They can probably sell more products if they didn't lie in their advertisements
It wouldn't anymore,It anymore

They'll get more people in the store I'd their products actually looked like the advertisements,Then they need to pay the store employees as much as they pay the people that make the ads.
They can probably sell more products if they didn't lie in their advertisements,well they seem to think this way works better

"Probably not. The point is to make you feel hungry cause some good looking food is on your screen and then you go to that place because the logo on your screen makes you think of that restaurant before anything else.

On the other hand, let's say they put some unappetizing looking food on your screen. Is that going to put you in a fast food mood? Is that going to associate a good image with your brand? Probably not cause now your brand is associated with a picture of a crappy burger instead of a nice looking fake one.

That's just my take though",">On the other hand, let's say they put some unappetizing looking food on your screen. Is that going to put you in a fast food mood? Is that going to associate a good image with your brand? 

I do agree that the image is better when it looks good and it tends to put me in a ""fast-food mood"" but I refuse to by it cause I know it doesn't really look like that and I'm sure they would sell 10x more products if the product looked closer to the photo, I'm not saying that it needs to look like the dog shit they serve now I'm just saying what's with the unrealistic standards? Any competent cook can make photogenic food just look at any cooking influencer. McDonald's is worth billions and can easily make a decent-looking burger that looks good in person and advertisements. The company is just too greedy to implement any changes and unfortunately, people will still choose to buy those crappy burgers which just further solidifies McDonald's goals of making the cheapest ""burger "" available to everyone 

(And by cheapest, I mean cheapest for McDonald's)

> Probably not cause now your brand is associated with a picture of a crappy burger instead of a nice looking fake one.

Would you rather your brand be referred to as a brand that advertises exactly that they sell (even if it's bad looking) Or a brand that is known to falsely advertise perfect looking food and provide horrendous looking food that taste like shit?ü§î"

For me nothing made sense. He said I was like an ideal woman for him and he was attracted to me, but after 3 days after we said we would try to be in a relationship he meant he couldn't develope feelings for me and wanted to break off the relationship and wants to stay friends. But oh well, too late for me as I was already madly in love with him, so I cut ties with him.

"I was having an emergency appointment to have the remnants of a tooth pulled, it had finally cracked and broke years after a root canal. The dentist was having trouble getting a grip on it to yank it out. I am always trying to control a panic attack whenever I'm in the chair. Nose breathing, happy place, maths problems, singing songs in my head, anything to distract from the impulse to flee...

  


This time however this obese old short tempered Pakistani dentist pulled my head deep into his moobs and got me in a headlock to brute force the tooth and all my anxiety just melted away and I felt like I was home.

  


I was a little disappointed when the tooth came out and he released me","My guy...What a story!

This tale will be told for generations to come!!"
"Yes, it‚Äôs nice.  When you‚Äôre getting your hair cut too. 

Problem is, I kinda feel a bit creepy about it after a sec if it happens too much.

I had no idea where to look, should I close my eyes, why are they so big, so‚Ä¶ out, so bouncy. After like 2 or 3 times I told my auntie she was too rough so I could get out of it. Well, we‚Äôre black so she didn‚Äôt care and told me stop being so tenderheaded if I want braids eventually.

The thing is between the over-reaching for tools on the other side of the chair, having them graze my face more than once, and the conversation that sounded like someone trying to get to know a person better, I could almost swear she was flirting.

I still considered it all innocent, but when she said there was some calcified areas that needed more scraping, and she leaned in with a breast pressing against my cheek‚Ä¶ well, I had to really think of other things to avoid an embarrassing reaction from occurring in my pants.

I never thought about it again until seeing this image. As I look back, a part of me still wonders what might have happened if I simply just asked her out on a date. Reality kept slapping me to say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an idiot. It was all innocent.‚Äù",Dude wrote a fucking erotic essay

"I‚Äôm not really sure, usually they‚Äôre in front of you, facing you, seeing how ones mouth is typically on the front, and arms are also typically used in front of one‚Äôs self.","So I'm someone who can understand how it happens given my visits for cleaning/maintenance of my teeth.

Here's how it works for me:

Sit down on the mechanical chair. The dental hygienist I happen to get for that day lowers the back of the chair until my head is lower than my feet. My body is essentially flat but my legs/feet are elevated a bit higher. At that point depending on the height of the hygienist she'll move the entire chair up or down so she's not breaking her back trying lean in to get a closer look at my teeth.

Then she moves over on her wheeled chair so my head and the headrest are essentially between her legs. So from my perspective her face is upside down when she looks down at me. 

So the concept of the dental hygienists chest pressing against the top of my head and even my forehead is something I've experienced. I can see how it's possible. Never really thought of it sexually or in a ""this feels great"" type of way because I am not comfortable with stuff in my mouth and so I'm spending nearly the whole appointment following her directions, trying not to gag, trying to focus on something besides the discomfort and occasional painful moment, etc...

Now I'm kind of curious how you and others get their teeth looked at and cleaned. So you're sitting up? And they're looking directly at you?"

Pal, If you don't see the problem on this then you have a problem...","I see your ""just because I haven't experienced it means it must not exist"" statement and will raise you with some personal experiences:

People do flirt with each other, sometimes in weird and unexpectedly physical ways. 

I can assume from you're replies that you're probably socially awkward, tightly wound and wrapped up in your perspective so you don't see it. You would also probably cry sexual assult if it happened to you, but the dentist I was referring to also asked me if I wanted to get lunch some time and joked about already passing 2nd base while her tits were still on me. I told her I was married and, I know this might sound strange, she made space after that and in following visits she didn't stick her tits on my head. What a coincidence!

Now, you will most likely not believe this experience at all or will try to twist the details again to your toxic agenda, but I think I've wasted enough time on you now.

Good luck with your future."

"schools really just don't care in general, regardless of what the situation is. i was groped once in 4th grade, a teacher witnessed it and did absolutely nothing to help me, a fellow classmate got groped by a student next to them, nobody took them seriously except for me and like two other people. i've heard stories of kids literally being beaten up (not just in my school), accused and catcalled and i've heard zero justice for any of them, it's disgusting. 

schools don't deserve to call themselves progressive until they fix this ongoing issue once and for all.","When I was in middle school there was a group of 3-4 boys who kept tossing pencils down girls' shirts.

Nobody even bothered reporting. I just threatened one of the boys after class (knee to balls, sort of shirt-grabbing conversation), and after that things ended.

Contact her parents. Yourself. Maybe if you feel like it hit on her mum. But indeed contact her parents,This is a great idea if the school doesn't do anything about it (aside from threatening for a lawsuit of course)

"I'm gonna copy my story from my discord messages

Last semester I was with this girl and I was taken advantage of by her. 
Her name was Taylor, and the first time we met up, I had already told her 

I didn't want to be with her after we matched on tinder and I found out she was going to be my RA 
but she asked me to come down and hang out anyway

So, eager to meet new people at school I did

She kept pushing me to drink and I drank
but that first night I stood my ground and told her I'm not gonna sleep with her, despite her trying to kiss me, cuddle me, feel me up 

I was too drunk to make it to my room so I stayed on her spare bed

I woke up and she was grinding on my leg, using me as a fucking sex toy 

I had no idea what to do and I just let it happen, she finished and I was too shocked to do anything. Too shook to sleep the rest of the night 

I left before she woke up, hoping she would take what she got from me and move on. But, she kept calling me back down 

I was scared of retribution

Of her doing something to fuck up my schooling

My career that I loved, the one thing in my life that made me feel like I belong, made me feel like I was where I need to be 

So i kept going back to her

And every time I tried to keep my distance, but she would push me to drink, smoke, etc. And I would to placate her, and to 'get over myself' as I told myself 

I'd get drunk and high to the point of not being able to stand steadily and she'd just grope me, start kissing me, and we would fuck so I could get out of the situation and leave 

Times I said I didn't want to hang out happened, but she'd just knock on my door and accost me in front of my roommate and I felt trapped. 

The one time I had the spine to say 'I don't want to have sex with you', she cried, called me nasty names, told me I was a piece of shit, and kicked me out. And that was the last time I saw her before I came back to Denver 

When I got back home I felt relief that she was 300 miles away, but also that what happened was my fault. Because I was weak, because I didn't deserve better, because this was all I could ever get. That it was my fault for not being a good partner in a relationship I never even wanted to be part of. 

I isolated myself over it

When I got back here, I tried talking to the girl I really wanted to be with down here, we hooked up a few times. But the last time I was with her, she kissed me goodbye, and something changed. She got mean, she got nasty, she pried insecurities out of me I wasn't ready to talk about and when she was done with me she threw that back in my face and insulted me over those insecurities.

And I was alone again

Taylor reached out a hand and I took it, because I didn't fully understand what she had done to me. And I needed someone here 

She had a boyfriend now and I felt like I was safe from her

But Saturday night, we were all hanging out in her room, Taylor, her boyfriend, and another girl I wanted to get to know. A girl I told taylor I was interested in

That girl was Jessie, and once we were all pretty fucking drunk (and Jess could hardly string a sentence together) Taylor started making out with her and telling her how bad she wanted to fuck her 

In front of me and her boyfriend

That made me realize that I wasn't the problem when I was with Taylor, that she was just a predator

I wasn't the asshole, I wasn't the POS because I was uncomfortable around her, that it wasn't me just being uncomfortable being close to someone. 

But that I was raped.

That this was a cycle that would continue

Per some of my friends down here I'm not the first guy she's assaulted.
Last semester there was another RA, Dillon. And some point during the semester (idk if this was before or after I met her) Taylor keyed herself into his room. (bc i guess RAs can do that) 

When he was understandably like ""what the fuck"" Taylor just said ""okay let's do this""

Dillon asked her what she meant and she said ""I know you want to fuck me"", pulled him close to her and groped him

and he ran away from his own room

He was so fucked up from that experience that by the end of the semester he packed up his shit, quit his job as an RA, and moved out to transfer. 

I heard the same exact story from multiple different people, 2 RAs, a girl I'm friends with who used to know Dillon, and another person who used to be friends with Dillon 

But when I confronted Taylor about it on Sunday, after all the shit with Jessie, she denied it, but couldn't keep her story straight

I'm trying to figure out who I need to go to in order to make sure she can't hurt anyone again

But at the same time I'm terrified

because I'm a guy, and she's a girl

she could just flip it and say I intimidated her, that Dillon lied to slander her. Some of the people I went to just asked ""well why were you drunk? why didn't you just leave? Why didn't you say no?"" 

I'm scared that nobody will believe me and I'm better off just sucking it up for the next 4 weeks, not ruffling any feathers and just trying to ignore her until she graduates and I never have to see her again.

You aren't alone OP, but ultimately chances are you have to find a way to move on on your own terms. Because the stigma around male victims of sexual assault makes it hard for the perpetrators to see justice.",You should contact the cops
The same in my primary school. There was a kid who was VERY touchy.,[deleted]
"It literally takes one claim from a woman to potentially ruin a mans life and future, so sad and messed up","If it makes you feel any better, false claims are incredibly rare.

"I got downvoted when I told the story of how I was followed on Instagram by a waitress who served me while I was eating alone. The stigma is just that, a stigma and it‚Äôs alive and well",She was stalking you?

"My friend just got accuses of rape a couple weeks ago. I know he didn't do anything but people were starting to believe the 20 girls who teamed up against him including a person who he had been friends with for 3 years and both of his ex's. The rumors started going around the school but after he talked to them they didn't do anything. He had to clear his name on his own by showing texts which were from one of the accuser's siblings who he is friends with showing communication between 2 accusers talking about what other things they could ""get him"" on. Also the accuser who was his friend for 3 years tried to sexually assualt him by coming to his house (before she started accusing him) she pushed him on his bad, got on top of him, pulled his pants down (not his boxers), and started humping him. No, I was not present for any of this but he told me and I asked a few of his friends who all told me this is the truth.",My dude I know it might be hard to accept but the odds of some non famous guy being accused falsely by two dozen people are basically nil
"Trust me, the same happens to girls. It‚Äôs usually way worse for guys though. I‚Äôm so sorry man","At my school they care when it happens to girls,Awhile back my female friend was SA‚Äôd and they school did a full investigation and Suspended the guy who did it,and rightfully so I just wish they‚Äôd do the same with guys"
But switch the roles and then it becomes national news‚Ä¶,"[110,000 women between the ages of 18 and 24 are raped every year in the USA according to the DOJ](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/24911006). It hardly ever becomes national news"

Just be my school and pretend like sexual assault isn‚Äôt a thing. And sweep any reports under the rug because the guy doing it is on the autism spectrum.,Even as a autistic I've seen how bad some can get.
I was sexually assaulted by other boys and all I got was yelled at for not wanting to go back into the changerooms with the same boys.,"School administrators are notoriously bad about dealing with sexual harassment and assault, no matter the genders"
"Yeah it's always been a load of bs that the moment a girl or girls say you either sexually harassed or assaulted them you get into tons of trouble as a guy and they never look into if it is true or not, until either the girl or girls come clean and you pray to god they do as soon as possible but usually the do so when it's too late at times. But the moment a guy or guys say the same thing they also do nothing about it, and say they'll look into it.

Like I get that there have been some causes of girls being sexually harassed and assaulted for long periods of time and nothing is done about at times but for some schools and cities to go to these lengths for one more than the other is why there will continue to be an uneven balance in equality among us all. Schools and Companies need to hold all to the same standards not just one group. Otherwise you get situations like what happened to that poor kid who had his life ruined by a bunch of girls who lied about him sexually assaulting all of them because in their words he was ugly.",">Like I get that there have been some causes of girls being sexually harassed and assaulted for long periods of time and nothing is done about at times

This happens extremely often. If you are interested in reading about some first-hand about the way universities and authorities handle these cases, I recommend reading ""[Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/24911006) by Jon Krakauer. 

Rape or sexual assault is simply extremely difficult to prove (and it isn't proven in a court of law more than 95% of the time). Because what evidence do you have that your boyfriend raped you? The fact that you had sex isn't proof. And if he didn't use any violence (since you were scared or asleep) you will have a hard time proving anything.

And how are you going to prove someone groped you at a party? There isn't any video evidence. There probably aren't any witnesses either if it happens within seconds.  

And you are arguing for equal standards, and that is something that should absolutely happen. But you also use the example of a guy who was falsely accused, which makes it seem like you are saying that the authorities and schools should make the burden of proof to prove a rape or SA even higher."
"Seems to me they do just about as much when it happens to women, too. You‚Äôre not alone here","At my school they care when it happens to girls,Awhile back my female friend was SA‚Äôd and they school did a full investigation and Suspended the guy who did it,and rightfully so I just wish they‚Äôd do the same with guys"

I still feel conflicted about it 15 years later","Nah. Your feelings are valid. It's so weird that she did that, and it's weird that your mom didn't ask the teacher about it."

Men have zero sexual autonomy.We can get raped, have no option of abortion, and a lifetime of child support while watching a woman raise our kids (zero chance of full custody for a man).

To sum it up: college footbal star, had it all, was acused by a classmate of rape. Spent 6 years in jail and 5 more in parole. Later the girl was recorded saying that it was all a lie. 

The girl was paid alot of money in settlements, and the only punishment she got was that she had to return the money. She didn't even appear in the court that decided that.

The most fucked up part to me was the fact that he had to prove his innocence to reverse the conviction, when it should be the the acussation trying to prove that he was guilty. 

When it comes to woman accusing man, it seems that is not ""innocent until proven guilty"", it's ""gulity until proven innocent"".

So yes, it takes just an acussation to destroy a man's life, but not the other way around.

The girl was paid alot of money in settlements, and the only punishment she got was that she had to return the money. She didn't even appear in the court that decided that.

The most fucked up part to me was the fact that he had to prove his innocence to reverse the conviction, when it should be the the acussation trying to prove that he was guilty. 

When it comes to woman accusing man, it seems that is not ""innocent until proven guilty"", it's ""gulity until proven innocent"".

Have you heard the story of Daisy Coleman? Let me tell you about it

14 year old girl is dropped on her front lawn, unconscious, in freezing temperatures with barely any clothing on, by a football star senior at her school from a prominent political family. When her mother found her hours later, her hair was wet and frozen and she had frostbite on her feet.

She and her 13 year old friend snuck out to party with this 17 year old (Matthew Barnett) and his friends. One of his friends had sex with the 13 year old and Barnett admitted to having sex with a ‚Äúbuzzed‚Äù Daisy while his friend recorded it on an iPhone. The video was deleted but had apparently been passed around the school. Police were never able to find it (the boy admitted he took the video though).

The 13 year old and the other boys said Daisy was incoherent and had to be carried out of the home.

3 of the boys were arrested, including Barnett. One for the rape of the 13 year old, one for filming the rape of Daisy, and Barnett for raping Daisy and dropping her outside in freezing temperatures. All but the rape charges for the 13 year old were dropped.

A special prosecutor was appointed after the charges were dropped due to allegations that the prosecutor was biased. He read Daisy her Miranda Rights in a completely unheard of move (which some believe was an attempt at intimidation), before getting her story of what happened. 

Barnett eventually pleaded guilty to one count of endangering a minor for leaving her outside in freezing temperatures. He was sentenced to 4 months in jail but that was suspended for 2 years probation instead.

The entire town turned on this 14 year old girl because this kid was good at football and his grandpa was a well known Republican state representative. 

Daisy and her brothers were bullied extensively at school and online to the point that her family decided to move. In the process of moving their house mysteriously burnt down.

After several failed attempts over the years, Daisy committed suicide in 2020. 4 months later her mother also committed suicide.

Several lives were, not only destroyed by this, but ended. The most fucked up part? I couldn‚Äôt remember her name so I googled ‚Äúgirl raped by football star kills herself‚Äù and had to scroll through several articles about different instances of the exact same thing to find this one.

So to say that accusers lives are never ruined is so unbelievably false and ridiculous. Accusations of rape are not a win for anyone. Either someone was raped or someone is being falsely accused of rape.","I never said it only affect men. What I said, and we have countless cases to prove it, is that an acussation from a woman is almost allways taken as being fact.

The punishment starts even before there is a conviction. People loose jobs, families and friends, and something their lives (like the story you provided) because of false acusstions.

And like I said it affects everyone, but you can't deny that it affects mostly man at this point."
You hope it‚Äôs a cultural shift of guys being abused instead of girls?,That's the least charitable reading of my message you could have possibly taken.

"You've misunderstood me. I never said that isn't the case (for either gender of perpetrator) because it's common knowledge that a history of being sexually abused can lead to the victim becoming offenders themselves at a higher rate than offenders who haven't experienced it themselves.

The subject of victims becoming perpetrators comes up in like every single thread about sexual assault regardless of gender, at least here on Reddit, and in my life it's certainly not a unique idea either."
"Remember when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock in the face and reddits take on it was ""this is a woman's fault""","I don't remember that.

Depending on where you went, you'd see a minority of people gaining traction talking shit about Jada for the situation, but the overwhelming attitude was an overblown amount of sympathy for her, with all this rhetoric trying to make it seem like she was a cancer patient or something that you'd need to be a real shitheel to joke about.

I also remember a significant amount of people *trying* to characterize the situation the same way you're trying to do right now. And you'd also see people using the situation as an excuse to get into other drama surrounding her, with an overwhelming air of her being some kind of manipulative devious entity with regards to their overall relationship. *That* did get a bit much."

>	Research shows that rates of false reporting
are frequently inflated, in part because of inconsistent definitions and protocols, or a weak understanding of sexual assault. Misconceptions about false reporting rates have direct, negative consequences and can contribute to why many victims don‚Äôt report sexual assaults (Lisak et
al., 2010). To improve the response to victims of sexual violence, law enforcement and service providers need a thorough understanding

Ahh yes America gas lighting people into WW3 by laundering money through Ukrainian and pretending it‚Äôs foreign aid while using tax payer money to line their pockets classic.,"War. War never changes.
In the year 1945, my great-great grandfather, serving in the army, wondered when he‚Äôd get to go home to his wife and the son he‚Äôd never seen. He got his wish when the US ended World War II by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The World awaited Armageddon; instead, something miraculous happened. We began to use atomic energy not as a weapon, but as a nearly limitless source of power.

People enjoyed luxuries once thought the realm of science fiction. Domestic robots, fusion-powered cars, portable computers. But then, in the 21st century, people awoke from the American dream.

Years of consumption lead to shortages of every major resource. The entire world unraveled. Peace became a distant memory. It is now the year 2077. We stand on the brink of total war, and I am afraid. For myself, for my wife, for my infant son ‚Äì because if my time in the army taught me one thing: it‚Äôs that war, war never changes"
