This is a repost Not even a title change I know cause i upvoted the other one and this one doesn t have my comment or the upvote However you did forget a crucial aspect the flair -> 
This one would be good anytime you make nazis angry and triggered it s a big win They should do Hitler black so it s easier to spot nazis online -> Eh I dunno about that one If you re doing a comedy or regular show I think there d be less pushback with a black hitler though even that might be taken as racism But the meme here is about a documentary Featuring a black hitler could be liable to people not only thinking it s just racist but that the whole show is bad because they re historically inaccurate Not sure if it s a good comparison but like a documentary about the African slave trade featuring a bunch of white dudes being forced to work on a plantation
r therightcantmeme -> These are making fun of Netflix nothing to do with politics unless someone brings them up

Am i missing something from the original Tarzan Afaik in all the movies he s been cast as white but i know it originated in comics or novels or something -> Disney has been making live action movies in which they race swap the main character People including myself would love to see Disney race swap Tarzan to a black man and see how well that goes over with the general population

Japan is more scared of North Korea I mean I am too -> Im fairly certain Japan is more worried about China given the number of times they tested ballistic missiles by firing them over Japanese airspace
Memers try not to make excuses for dictatorships challenge impossible -> B but America bad
So your saying America is bad for warning other countries that they might be bombed with nukes that are severely times more powerful then the ones dropped on Japan because America bomb japan in word war two -> I m saying that the US is the only country that used nuclear bombs and Japan experienced it And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries The power of nuclear bombs is relative At that time those two bombs were the most powerful weapons
Yes how dare America bomb Hitler s allies ending a world war Monsters -> You re expecting people to know anything about history
Every time a country threatens another with nukes it just shows that they only care about being on top not protecting their people -> It also shows the country is not strong military wise It s like bringing a gun to a fist fight
The big powers about to engage in nuclear war Japan who didn t build any nuclear weapons because of principles -> I mean if I was ground zero for that shit I wouldn t want to make nukes either
I m saying that the US is the only country that used nuclear bombs and Japan experienced it And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries -> If that s true it s great news since the US has suffered some pretty notable military defeats since WWII and never used nukes If the equivalency you re drawing between the US and Russia is true the world should be spared some truly horrific things
Well maybe they should ve thought about that before touching our boats -> or you before touching their submarine
Wtf japan gonna do watch send hentai army -> fr japan has devolved so much from its past self
Don t worry guys Japan has the power of anime by their side -> The power of anime failed twice
Russia North Korea and China have nukes But what do Japan have Humans in planes This is a joke please don t take offense -> Fun fact American soldiers called the kamikaze pilots Baka Bombs
america bombed japan because of the imperials it was for the best -> Yeah and bin laden banged the plane on tower cause he didn t like its location it was for the best
The comments here are concerning Japan was not nuked to save American lives America already won the war The specifics of why are argued by historians some say it was to ensure a more absolute surrender some say it was to ease control of Japan under America some say it was to show American dominance among the allies but the most common explanation is that it was a show of force against soviets who had just entered the war to control as much of the region as possible If it was because the japanese wouldn t have surrendered they d nuke Tokyo And no this doesn t somehow absolve imperial Japan of their crimes They were far worse than America throughout the course of the war arguably worse than Nazi Germany but that doesn t make nuking civilians ok in the way internment camps weren t ok -> To save American lives is definetly one of the reasons for the nukes It can be debated whether or not it was justified but the facts are that a mainland invasion of Japan would be costly
Japan of all countries seems to have the shittiest luck Constantly at war in the past and then nuked twice -> A mainland invasion would have been worse for Japan than nukes
Jeez I wonder which country invented the abomination that are nukes Should ve just stayed as an energy source SMH -> Yeah how dare they figure it out first before the Germans and Soviets Should ve just invaded Japan instead and lost a million men and god knows how many civilians instead s
Oooh downvotes yall salty Is this why Americans don t want to teach history -> You dumb fucks know that every American school is different right I learned about everything our government did from manifest destiny to slavery the Tuskegee experiment Mk ultra and all the rest If your understanding of a country is limited to reddit memes you probably don t have room to talk about the ignorance of others Also you know we dropped those nukes on Hitler s allies to end a world war right What country are you from Let s see how well you know your own history
Im fairly certain Japan is more worried about China given the number of times they tested ballistic missiles by firing them over Japanese airspace -> North Korean missiles launched over Japan Korean missile launches over Japan svg
Why -> Because they re irrational to the point of being self destructive
North Korea isn t a threat to anyone especially not a threat if you live in the USA No country can invade us successfully -> He didn t say North Korea is a threat to the USA Just that Japan is worried about North Korea as they should be with them constantly shooting missiles in their direction
B but America bad -> Always it s never done anything good or noteworthy like Europe and Asia Obviously
No you just don t understand how big brained and original OP is -> Fair point I ll take my leave
I agree it was probably statistically needed but Jesus Christ they dropped two nuclear bombs on large cities and instatly pulverized hundreds of thousands of innocent individuals who never did anything wrong -> It s not like the former was any better I know this sounds like a tribe mentality but better them than us ya know I love my great grandfather and I d rather him with us than a framed purple heart of a great man I d never have the privilege to know Memes like this paint the picture that the United States did this for shits and giggles rather than to end the war hundreds of good men would die to a population who viewed their emperor as a God and openly and plainly supported the subjugation of Asia
I m saying that the US is the only country that used nuclear bombs and Japan experienced it And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries The power of nuclear bombs is relative At that time those two bombs were the most powerful weapons -> So your logic is America shouldn t have any right to warn it s ally that two countries that are extremely close may nuke them a lot because American nuke them nearly a hundred years ago
Tell me did US used the nuclear weapon on military objects or basically just on two huge cities with lots of civilians and children So yeah it looks like a monster move -> We dropped leaflets telling them the bomb was coming to destroy the military bases in those cities The Japanese government told them it was a trick The real monstrous thing was the fire bombing of Tokyo that was only done to break their spirits
They bombed Japan after them surrendered and they bombed time -> That is completely wrong they literally had to worse Hirohito to surrender at gun point lol
Many historians say it was actually Russia declaring war on Japan and not the atomic bombs that convinced them to surrender EDIT Adding my academic sources since y all are skeptical Gen Anami on Aug remarked that the atomic bombings were no more menacing than the fire bombing that Japan had endured for months Ward Wilson in Foreign Policy bomb didnt beat japan stalin did Prime Minister Kantaro Suzuki explained on Aug that Japan had to surrender quickly because the Soviet Union will take not only Manchuria Korea Karafuto but also Hokkaido This would destroy the foundation of Japan We must end the war when we can deal with the United States Historians Gar Alperovitz and Martin Sherwin hiroshima anniversary japan atomic bombs Even Anami s fantastic suggestion that the United States had more than atomic bombs and planned to bomb Tokyo next did not change the opinions of either the peace party or the war party at all Rather what decisively changed the views of the Japanese ruling elite was the Soviet entry into the war It catapulted the Japanese government into taking immediate action For the first time it forced the government squarely to confront the issue of whether it should accept the Potsdam terms Tsuyoshi Hasegawa Tsuyoshi Hasegawa article html -> And many other historians say this is bullshit
It also shows the country is not strong military wise It s like bringing a gun to a fist fight -> It s like bringing a suicide vest to a fist fight
I m pretty sure japn doesn t make nukes because it s in a treaty with the us -> This is the answer Most Asian countries are in a non proliferation treaty with the United States It s why the RoK Japan Australia NZ and plenty of other countries over there don t have nuclear weapons The issue with that is when a rogue state like NK starts creating their arsenal a whole new set of problems arise Now a lot of people in the RoK a plurality of the population think they should go nuclear The US isn t seen as the unbeatable protector anymore and so these non proliferation treaties may be out the window soon Is the answer to do away with all of them Make a shit ton more That s up for debate Should countries continue to rely on US protection or arm up to protect themselves if things get bad The geopolitical landscape of the world is changing as we speak It s getting harder to see how things will stand at the end of the decade much less farther out than that
Japan who didn t make nukes because they can t after the WW treaty -> Yeah Imperial Japan would ve had no problem building nukes They would have loved nukes IMO
I mean if I was ground zero for that shit I wouldn t want to make nukes either -> One would think that lesson to be learned was to be prepared with nukes for the next time it happens and not allow the enemy to once again have bigger weapons than you
And I m also saying that the US would use nuclear weapons like other countries Please elaborate -> M A D
I don t know if it was a positive thing to use nuclear bombs on Japan and I don t know the background reasons why the US did this But I know that the mentality and the reason of the US leaders are changed based on what I see in worse There are too many things that are not right -> At the time it was use nukes and hopefully scare Japan into surrendering or doing a mainland invasion of Japan which had horrifically high casualty projections since the Japanese would likely have fought to the end Projected casualties for us forces were at least in the hundreds of thousands interesting fact is that the us still gives out purple hearts originally made for this planned invasion because of how many losses were expected and much more for Japanese and Japanese civilians
or you before touching their submarine -> No why would I do that
Fun fact American soldiers called the kamikaze pilots Baka Bombs -> Seriously Never knew this one
Yeah and bin laden banged the plane on tower cause he didn t like its location it was for the best -> im sorry they could ve either lost thousands of men trying to invade or they could ve bombed it it was the safer option it was to stop ww besides osama banged the plane into the twin towers because of his extremist goals america bombed japan to speed up the war they didn t want to lose men are we also going to ignore that japan had recently bombed pearl harbour also rampaged through nanking a few years earlier do you think that s ok so again a few bombing seems perfectly fair and fine after seeing all the atrocities that japan has done against american and asia
To save American lives is definetly one of the reasons for the nukes It can be debated whether or not it was justified but the facts are that a mainland invasion of Japan would be costly -> That that saved American lives is the only thing we can be sure of
Yeah how dare they figure it out first before the Germans and Soviets Should ve just invaded Japan instead and lost a million men and god knows how many civilians instead s -> Pshh as if the Germans and Soviets even knew bombs can be made from nuclear If they did it wouldn t have become a secret weapon Many Japanese civilias who had nothing to do with the war also died from the nuclear bombing Humanity should ve just stayed with their sharp sticks
You dumb fucks know that every American school is different right I learned about everything our government did from manifest destiny to slavery the Tuskegee experiment Mk ultra and all the rest If your understanding of a country is limited to reddit memes you probably don t have room to talk about the ignorance of others Also you know we dropped those nukes on Hitler s allies to end a world war right What country are you from Let s see how well you know your own history -> Of course they don t know and they don t want to know anything that doesn t support their blind delusion that America Bad
North Korean missiles launched over Japan Korean missile launches over Japan svg -> Well that sucks having to worry about different power hungry countries doing that
Because they re irrational to the point of being self destructive -> They re a lot of things but they re not irrational What they re doing works exactly as intended
might be cus they the ones currently threatening them -> North Korea has a no first strike policy United States doesn t
And it was a good thing we used them back then Really sucks for those killed by them but it made sure folks don t use em See it to believe it and the world saw it -> Actually Japan had started negotiations for surrender before we ever dropped the bombs The fire bombing of Tokyo had done a real number on their morale Problem is Japan didn t want to remove their emperor The emperor who was responsible for all the atrocities Japan committed during the war And America wasn t willing to concede his position So really we nuked people over one dude surrendering After the bombs the emporor restructured the entire empire to make the emperor just a figurehead instead of an actual ruler and they signed a new constitution starting to move to the democracy we know now Op s point is still nonsense but the context to when we dropped the nukes is important Like incredibly important
We dropped leaflets telling them the bomb was coming to destroy the military bases in those cities The Japanese government told them it was a trick The real monstrous thing was the fire bombing of Tokyo that was only done to break their spirits -> deleted
What military object is big enough to nuke without damaging the surrounding area Now let s talk about all the civilians the Japanese killed in China -> What military object is big enough to nuke without damaging the surrounding area This just proves that there was no need to use THAT kind of weapon Now let s talk about all the civilians the Japanese killed in China So basically what you re sying is Hey Japanese have killed civilians so we need to kill Japanese civilians to prevent this And besides that we need pollute their cities with radiation so that future generations would suffer from cancer Is that what you re trying to say with this sentence
That is completely wrong they literally had to worse Hirohito to surrender at gun point lol -> That s a common myth Japan was ready to surrender This was a show of force against the soviets not the japanese
Which ones -> Not a historian but does Truman s chief of staff work Or then Gen Dwight Eisenhower Or general Curtis LeMay All internal documents at time imply that Japan was ready to surrender They had no resources and morale was already broken Perhaps Hiroshima might have made Japan earlier but certainly Nagasaki was nuked purely as a show of force against the Soviets the us really bombed hiroshima
Good thing you aren t a historian -> Yup that s why I m citing them and not myself Your point
It s like bringing a suicide vest to a fist fight -> Fortunately that level of genius can cause them to be lax in their maintenance of their vest
One would think that lesson to be learned was to be prepared with nukes for the next time it happens and not allow the enemy to once again have bigger weapons than you -> Mutually Assured Destruction also abbreviated as MAD is exactly what you re describing It works if you want to always be enemies forever and ever and always have the threat of deleting all life on earth as a present issue The best solution to nuclear weapons is to not have the fucking things Nobody wins
M A D -> Okay But after reading your other comments what are you really trying to say It seems like you re trying to make some larger point and I don t understand what it is Are you anti US anti nukes anti west What was your motivation behind making this post
No why would I do that -> Why would you touch my submarine
im sorry they could ve either lost thousands of men trying to invade or they could ve bombed it it was the safer option it was to stop ww besides osama banged the plane into the twin towers because of his extremist goals america bombed japan to speed up the war they didn t want to lose men are we also going to ignore that japan had recently bombed pearl harbour also rampaged through nanking a few years earlier do you think that s ok so again a few bombing seems perfectly fair and fine after seeing all the atrocities that japan has done against american and asia -> US bombed civilians not the Japanese army when japan attacked pearl harbour it was US navy not US civilians on Target If you think bombing civilians seems fair as it ends the war quickly then so were attacks and its perfectly fine for putin to bomb Ukrainian people Maybe we should ask him to nuke up Ukraine and end the war quickly it would be safer option
Pshh as if the Germans and Soviets even knew bombs can be made from nuclear If they did it wouldn t have become a secret weapon Many Japanese civilias who had nothing to do with the war also died from the nuclear bombing Humanity should ve just stayed with their sharp sticks -> The Germans and Soviets did know Secret weapon The research program to build it was secret as it was for the Germans and Soviets Did you think anyone would just advertise they were trying to build one
Well that sucks having to worry about different power hungry countries doing that -> I agree OP is focused on what happened years ago and not what s happening in
hb u try being a dictator for generations without getting picked off by a us drone strike or any of your own ppl a lot of ppl make fun of kim jong un but wouldnt survive a year in his place -> america has ruined the dprk and now all the americans do is make fun of it so you re telling me that a country that we destroyed and forced it into poverty has turned juche dictatorship on us and now wants to destroy our country too that s completely unfair i cannot believe this
Actually Japan had started negotiations for surrender before we ever dropped the bombs The fire bombing of Tokyo had done a real number on their morale Problem is Japan didn t want to remove their emperor The emperor who was responsible for all the atrocities Japan committed during the war And America wasn t willing to concede his position So really we nuked people over one dude surrendering After the bombs the emporor restructured the entire empire to make the emperor just a figurehead instead of an actual ruler and they signed a new constitution starting to move to the democracy we know now Op s point is still nonsense but the context to when we dropped the nukes is important Like incredibly important -> You forgot to mention Japan demanded to manage its own disarmament only Japan could try its own war criminals and Japan to keep it s occupied territories in Asia I don t even think that qualifies as a negotiation
Are u being sarcastic -> Not at all They were gonna get used once they were created Better at that point in time rather try em later where it would have been much worse And yes the k people who died didn t deserve it but neither did those killed in the Tokyo fire bombing campaign the month before Which no one ever mentions killed more then the two bombs combined Can you imagine if the first time they were used was when McArthur wanted to use them in the Korean War and had both sides use them Or worse even later in history It really does suck but it was probably the scenario with the least amount of casualties Cause once again as soon as they were invented they were gonna get used
What military object is big enough to nuke without damaging the surrounding area This just proves that there was no need to use THAT kind of weapon Now let s talk about all the civilians the Japanese killed in China So basically what you re sying is Hey Japanese have killed civilians so we need to kill Japanese civilians to prevent this And besides that we need pollute their cities with radiation so that future generations would suffer from cancer Is that what you re trying to say with this sentence -> proofes Proves
That s a common myth Japan was ready to surrender This was a show of force against the soviets not the japanese -> That s a common myth there was no indication japan was about to surrender The us chose to use nukes instead of the planned invasion which would have had a lot more casualties on both sides but especially the japanese The fact that it was a show of force against the soviets is true but that was just one of the reasons for using them
Yeah but actually them send the surrender message day before the launch of the nuking but somehow the translation went wrong or manipulated and become we will fight till the end -> This is misinformation At best the standing military splintered which it did with some of them defecting and surrendering and the main imperial military and the emperor himself remaining defiant
Not a historian but does Truman s chief of staff work Or then Gen Dwight Eisenhower Or general Curtis LeMay All internal documents at time imply that Japan was ready to surrender They had no resources and morale was already broken Perhaps Hiroshima might have made Japan earlier but certainly Nagasaki was nuked purely as a show of force against the Soviets the us really bombed hiroshima -> Ready to surrender and Have surrendered are extremely different things Ready to surrender is an opinion Either you ve surrendered or you haven t Japan started the war with the United States The United States warned Japan that it would drop atomic bombs on Japan and demanded Japan surrender Japan did not surrender The US dropped the first bomb and waited several days for Japan to surrender Japan did not surrender The US dropped the second bomb Japan surrendered If Japan had been ready to surrender then why didn t they US warning to Japanese citizens about the atomic bomb leaflets japan
Mutually Assured Destruction also abbreviated as MAD is exactly what you re describing It works if you want to always be enemies forever and ever and always have the threat of deleting all life on earth as a present issue The best solution to nuclear weapons is to not have the fucking things Nobody wins -> If you don t have something that enemy will fear then the enemy will come for you and your things It s how the world works
Guy who thinks American gun laws make sense -> Nuclear weapons keep the world at peace The only reason another Napoleon or Hitler can t happen again is that when everybody is capable of mutually assured destruction there is no point in conquest wars
Okay But after reading your other comments what are you really trying to say It seems like you re trying to make some larger point and I don t understand what it is Are you anti US anti nukes anti west What was your motivation behind making this post -> Satire
US bombed civilians not the Japanese army when japan attacked pearl harbour it was US navy not US civilians on Target If you think bombing civilians seems fair as it ends the war quickly then so were attacks and its perfectly fine for putin to bomb Ukrainian people Maybe we should ask him to nuke up Ukraine and end the war quickly it would be safer option -> im not saying any bombing is justified but this one was japan was performing some disgusting atrocities during this time and america bombing japan is completely justified for what japan was doing nanking massacre cannibalism australian nurses massacre pearl harbour and many other atrocities bombing japan is completely fair and justified
The Germans and Soviets did know Secret weapon The research program to build it was secret as it was for the Germans and Soviets Did you think anyone would just advertise they were trying to build one -> Just wait til he finds out about the German scientists that defected from the Nazis and worked on the Manhattan project
I agree OP is focused on what happened years ago and not what s happening in -> I mean the meme as a meme is pretty funny not gonna lie Im not sure if OP is purposefully trying to make a political statement or if they simply meant it as a funny bit of irony
You can worry about the US and UK to if you like -> and jeff
More than Pearl Harbor got This is a weird hill to die on -> deleted
proofes Proves -> Didn t notice it thx
That s a common myth there was no indication japan was about to surrender The us chose to use nukes instead of the planned invasion which would have had a lot more casualties on both sides but especially the japanese The fact that it was a show of force against the soviets is true but that was just one of the reasons for using them -> Japan wanted to conditionally surrender
This is misinformation At best the standing military splintered which it did with some of them defecting and surrendering and the main imperial military and the emperor himself remaining defiant -> bombings japan did not produce its surrender
Source Even after the second bombing they didn t unconditionally surrender otherwise they d have haded over their scumbag emperor and put his head on a pike -> Do you really think is easy to make a political decision after the devastation caused by the human abomination bombings japan did not produce its surrender
It wasn t What Are you picking up history lessons from Russian propaganda -> Every state in this world do something scatchy and you cannot say one state is the Utopia without evil corruption and manipulation because naturally this is an Utopia
If you don t have something that enemy will fear then the enemy will come for you and your things It s how the world works -> Yeah normal military does that job just fucking fine No reason to desecrate an entire city with invisible poison for a decade or more You also can have ya know alliances If Ukraine was in NATO Russia would have hesitated a lot more in terms of invading it they probably would still invade it because Putin is pretty fucking insane and power hungry
Nuclear weapons keep the world at peace The only reason another Napoleon or Hitler can t happen again is that when everybody is capable of mutually assured destruction there is no point in conquest wars -> I think we already have another one of those in Putin of Russia yoinking Ukraine It s not going unresisted but motherfucker still trying to be a Stalin not communist boogaloo MAD may ward off conquerers on a large scale but nukemania still kinda makes tensions way too fucking high and puts so much on the line There s no reason to have the threat of deleting the entire human race as a deterrent besides being insane
im not saying any bombing is justified but this one was japan was performing some disgusting atrocities during this time and america bombing japan is completely justified for what japan was doing nanking massacre cannibalism australian nurses massacre pearl harbour and many other atrocities bombing japan is completely fair and justified -> All these atrocities were carried out by Japanese army not their civilians Bombing of civilians can t be justified in any way there can be no exceptions to this If US can justify nuking innocent old youngs and kids to ashes using the pretext of self defence or ending up war Putin is fair and can justify bombing Ukrainians as he is trying to keep away nato from its borders its a self defence and tomorrow he nukes up Ukraine it would be fair as it will end up the war Bin laden was fair and justified as he attacked US civilians only to take revenge against US as they were bombing up middle east and carrying out atrocities on civilians Rules should be same for everyone without any exceptions Stop living the myth that only US enemies carry out atrocities when US did the same throughout the history Japanese soldiers bodies were all mutilated equally and women were raped they attacked the civilian and killed families and took their family swords as possession After ww of the Japanese family swords were in US as the soldiers brought them home looting the families they killed They are even available today Several thousand women were raped in iraq syria and Afghanistan by US soldiers Civilians were killed and not a single soldier were convicted for these atrocities over years They even opend fire from helicopter on Civilians to kill a single target and innocent by standers all while laughing about it and those personal were removed from service and let go on bail while the reporter who released the video was jailed for leaking sensitive video
Just wait til he finds out about the German scientists that defected from the Nazis and worked on the Manhattan project -> The other german scientists that built the v rockets would blow his mind
What would you call this -> Anything but a meme
Smile with your eyes not with your mouth -> Exactly
Lmao no -> well yes
That s got to be the worst argument I ve heard in a while You re saying that using coal as fuel is fine even though there is a better cleaner and safer energy at your fingertips You ve got to be trolling -> I m not
But they did stop the process for almost a year after Russia shut off gas They could have kept them but chose not to -> Almost a year More like months They were originally scheduled to shut down on Dec but were postponed until April And they couldn t keep them because no T V no workers and no fuel elements
No you actually dont The only reason these reactors were shut down is because some Idiots decided they dont want nuclear energy because wind and solar energy is so much better lmao to that -> Just because that s why they were shut down now doesn t mean that you could have ran them forever otherwise
like any trash we need to find ways to reduce reuse and recycle -> Pls when u find a way to reuse glassfibre let us know
I m not -> Okay
You can t do that with Nuclear Reactors Once the shutdown process starts it is very expensive and also unfeasible to really prolong it -> But they did At least for a couple of months
Pls when u find a way to reuse glassfibre let us know -> why me i am a simple electrician lol
But they did At least for a couple of months -> Nah It was talked to do so but is dangerous nuclear plants needs manteinance if they will be used but if you have already years to dismantle them I wouldn t be surprised that Prypiat plants be in better state Too late to stop that sadly
I forgot what I was gonna comment -> Thank you
Then the nose would start to grow because it wasn t growing -> But when it grows the statement becomes true so his nose won t grow
His nose doesn t grow if he s wrong about predicting the future which is what is being implied here My nose grows is a statement that can be true or false My nose will now grow is a prediction of events yet to occur It is not a lie nor is it the truth -> It is inevitable
bro just discovered self referential paradox carry on bro you ll soon stumble upon the halting problem and the class of unsolvable problems -> In particular this is a proof that a Turing machine that accepts if and only if a given statement is a lie cannot exist as it would lead to a logical contradiction
He becomes a human vibrator -> I dont think thats what he meant when he said he wanted to be a real boy
His other nose grows -> You mean the lower horn
But when it grows the statement becomes true so his nose won t grow -> It s a repeating cycle of growing and shrinking Kind of like how it is in life
How about My nose is going to grow in the next seconds -> Still a prediction of the future
I dont think thats what he meant when he said he wanted to be a real boy -> Well I guess he is now I mean his wood is pretty hard
It s a repeating cycle of growing and shrinking Kind of like how it is in life -> Like some kind of thrust mechanism power drill sex toy
It wasn t true at the moment he said it -> But it becomes true after
Like some kind of thrust mechanism power drill sex toy -> Precisely
